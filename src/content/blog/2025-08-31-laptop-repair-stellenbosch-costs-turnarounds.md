faq:
  - q: "Do you collect my laptop and return it after repair?"
    a: "Yes—subject to availability in Stellenbosch. We can arrange pickup/drop-off for diagnostics, screen work and OS repairs. Ask on [/contact/](/contact/)."
  - q: "How long do repairs take?"
    a: "Diagnostics are same-day in most cases. Common fixes like Windows reinstalls are usually same/next-day. Screen and battery jobs depend on part availability—often next-day if in stock, 2–4 working days if we need to order."
  - q: "What warranty do repairs come with?"
    a: "Parts carry the supplier warranty (typically 3–12 months); workmanship is covered under our CPA-aligned guarantee. You’ll also get a job completion note and lawful e-waste handling where applicable."

> **TL;DR**: If your laptop’s screen is cracked, the battery’s dying, or Windows is painfully slow, you don’t have to guess the cost or timeline. Below are honest Stellenbosch price ranges in ZAR, realistic turnarounds, and when pickup/drop-off or remote support is fastest.

## What you’ll learn
- Typical **ZAR price ranges** for screens, batteries, keyboards, storage and software fixes.
- **Same/next-day** expectations vs cases where parts must be ordered.
- When **remote support** solves it now, and when we need the device.
- How pickup/drop-off works for campus and town residences.
- How to avoid repeat issues (dust, power, heat, and “bloat” in Windows).

## Real-world costs in Stellenbosch (typical ranges)

> Exact pricing depends on model, part grade and supplier stock. We’ll confirm a final quote after diagnostics.

| Fault / Service | Typical Cost (ZAR) | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| **Screen replacement** | 1 600–4 500+ | Most 14–15.6" non-touch panels are 1 600–2 800; high-res, touch, OLED or Apple panels cost more. See [Laptop screen replacement](/services/laptop-screen-replacement-labour/). |
| **Battery replacement** | 900–2 200 | Genuine/OEM vs compatible affects price; some ultrabooks require chassis teardown. |
| **SSD upgrade / data migration** | 1 100–2 800 | Includes drive + cloning where healthy; data recovery quoted separately. See [SSD upgrade & clone](/services/ssd-upgrade-bundle-clone-swap/). |
| **Windows reinstall (with backup)** | 950–1 600 | Includes cleanup, drivers, updates and “known folders” setup ([Windows reinstall with backup](/services/windows-reinstall-with-backup/)). |
| **Malware cleanup / tune-up** | 650–1 200 | Often same-day; remote is possible if the machine boots. See [Malware removal](/services/virus-malware-removal/). |
| **Board-level / liquid damage** | Quote after assessment | Diagnostics essential; success depends on corrosion and time since spill. |

### Where you can save
- **Bring the charger** (for battery and power diagnostics).
- **Describe symptoms clearly** (e.g., “backlight works but image is dark at angles” → specific panel type).
- **Approve a standard SSD** if you don’t need premium NVMe; it’s plenty fast for student use.

## Turnaround times you can actually plan around

- **Same-day (often):** diagnostics, malware cleanup, minor fixes, RAM/SSD swaps, OS reinstall.  
- **Next-day:** battery swaps (in stock), many non-touch panels, hinge tightening, keyboard swaps.  
- **2–4 working days:** special-order screens/batteries, certain ultrabook assemblies, liquid-damage cleaning + observation.  
- **Longer:** board-level repair or rare part sourcing.

> We’ll give you a realistic ETA at check-in. Exams? Tell us—**we prioritize time-critical jobs** where possible.

## “PC repair near me” — remote, drop-off, or pickup?

**Remote support (fastest when it fits)**  
If your laptop boots and has internet, we can often fix **slow Windows**, pop-ups, updates and driver issues via remote session—no travel time. See [Remote support session](/services/remote-support-setup/).

**Drop-off (most hardware jobs)**  
Screens, batteries, keyboards and thermal work are best done at the bench with anti-static handling. You can drop off in tellenbosch; many quick jobs are **same/next-day**.

**Pickup / drop-off (by arrangement)**  
Short on time? We can collect and return in town/campus **subject to availability**. Request it on [Contact us](/contact/).

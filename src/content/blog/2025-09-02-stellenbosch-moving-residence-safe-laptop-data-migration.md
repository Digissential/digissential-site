  title: "Safe move checklist (backs up, migrates and reconnects without drama)"
  steps:
    - "Back up first: OneDrive/Google Drive syncing + copy Documents/Pictures/Desktop to an external drive. On macOS, run a Time Machine backup."
    - "Export essentials: browser bookmarks, authenticator recovery codes, Wi-Fi passwords and any license keys. Note your Microsoft/Apple ID."
    - "Health check: confirm SMART ‘Good’, Windows Update/macOS Software Update clean, ≥15% free space."
    - "Pack the kit: charger, USB-C hub/Ethernet, external drive, printer/monitor cables. Transport the laptop in a padded sleeve (don’t squeeze the lid)."
    - "At the new flat: connect router/ONT, set Wi-Fi SSIDs & passwords, join 5 GHz for speed (2.4 GHz for range), then re-sign into apps and verify cloud sync."
faq:
  - q: "Can you move my data and apps for me?"
    a: "Yes. We can clone/transfer user profiles and set up a new laptop. If drives are healthy, most jobs are same/next-day. Book a remote session to get started."
  - q: "Will I lose anything?"
    a: "Not if you back up first. We recommend a cloud sync plus an external copy before you move. We verify transfers and keep your old drive as a fallback when possible."
  - q: "My Wi-Fi is flaky in the new place—now what?"
    a: "Use 5 GHz for speed, 2.4 GHz (20 MHz) for reach, move the router high with line of sight, and pick channels 1/6/11 (2.4) or 36–48/149–165 (5). We can tune this remotely."
  - q: "Do you follow POPIA?"
    a: "Yes—least-privilege access, encrypted handling where applicable, and clear retention. We can sign an NDA on request."

> **TL;DR:** **Back up before you unplug.** Export passwords and recovery codes, pack your charger & external drive, and set up **5 GHz Wi-Fi** first in the new flat. If anything misbehaves (Outlook, printers, iCloud/OneDrive), we’ll sort it via a **remote session**.

## 7 days before your move (prep that saves hours)
- **Backups on:** confirm OneDrive/Google Drive is green; do a **Time Machine** backup on macOS or a quick external copy on Windows.  
- **Licenses & keys:** note Office/Creative Cloud sign-ins, app keys, BitLocker/Recovery keys, and authenticator **recovery codes**.  
- **Clean & update:** run Windows Update/macOS Software Update; update browsers.  
- **Check disk health:** SMART “Good”; if **Caution/Bad**, clone to a new SSD before moving.

## Pack like a pro (so nothing goes missing)
- **Cables & chargers** in a labelled zip-bag.  
- **External drive** with the backup (don’t crush it).  
- **USB-C hub + Ethernet** (great for setting up Wi-Fi and printers).  
- **Screens/printers:** take photos of how things were plugged in.

## First power-up in the new place
1. **Router/ONT first.** Place it **high**, clear sight lines. Use **5 GHz** SSID for your laptop.  
2. **Sign-ins:** Microsoft/Apple IDs, OneDrive/iCloud Desktop/Documents, browsers, Teams/Zoom.  
3. **Email clients:** Outlook may re-index; avoid killing it mid-sync. If you use local PST/Outlook data, confirm it’s included in your backup before moving.  
4. **Printers/scanners:** reinstall drivers if Windows/macOS didn’t auto-detect.  
5. **Test sync:** create a test file on Desktop and confirm it appears on your phone/cloud.

If Wi-Fi drops/lag appear, see **[Wi-Fi/Network setup](/services/wifi-network-setup/)**.

## Common pitfalls (and how to dodge them)
- **Forgotten 2FA:** print/download **recovery codes**; keep a spare authenticator app signed in.  
- **Only-cloud or only-external:** do **both** if you can—cloud + external copy.  
- **Squeezed lids:** don’t pack the laptop tight; it’s how hairline **screen cracks** happen.  
- **App licenses:** some tools de-activate on new hardware—keep keys handy.  
- **Mailbox bloat:** if Outlook is slow, archive old mail and compact data after the move.

---

## When to ask for help
- New laptop needs **profile transfer** and apps re-installed.  
- Old drive **failing** (SMART warnings) or the machine **won’t boot**.  
- Wi-Fi keeps dropping in your new flat; you need quick tuning or a mesh plan.

We can do most of this **remotely** and send you a short checklist afterward.

## Final word
Moves are when data gets lost and passwords go missing. Do the **backup + export** steps, place the router well, and re-sign into your core apps in order. If anything stalls, we’ll jump on a **remote** and get you settled quickly in your new Stellenbosch spot.

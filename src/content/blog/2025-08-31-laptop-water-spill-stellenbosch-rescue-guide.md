  title: "Safe first steps after a laptop water-spill (do this, not that)"
  steps:
    - "Power down immediately and unplug the charger; hold the power button for ~10 seconds to shut off if needed."
    - "Disconnect removable power and accessories: charger, USB devices, SD cards; if the battery is easily removable, take it out."
    - "Blot—don’t wipe—visible liquid with paper towel; tilt to guide liquid out of ports, but do not shake."
    - "Leave the laptop open in an inverted 'tent' or upside-down 'V' so liquid can drain; use room airflow, not heat."
    - "Book a diagnostic right away for internal cleaning and inspection before corrosion sets in."
faq:
  - q: "Does the rice trick work?"
    a: "No. Rice doesn’t reach internal layers and can leave dust in ports. The risk is corrosion under chips and connectors—only a proper bench clean helps."
  - q: "Can I keep using it if it still turns on?"
    a: "It might run for a while, then fail as corrosion develops. Power it off, avoid charging, and bring it in for inspection and cleaning."
  - q: "What liquids are worst?"
    a: "Sugary drinks, milk and salt water are highly conductive and corrosive. They need **urgent** cleaning and flushing to prevent board damage."
  - q: "How much will it cost and how long?"
    a: "Diagnosis/cleaning is usually same-day/next-day. Costs vary with damage: light spills may be a clean-and-test; severe cases may need part replacement or data recovery."

> **TL;DR:** **Power off, unplug, don’t heat it, and don’t “rice” it.** Get a **same-day diagnostic** so we can clean the board and connectors before corrosion sets in. If data matters, ask about **safe imaging** first.

## Why the first hours matter (and why “it still works” is risky)

Liquid creeps under key components and connectors. Even when a spill dries, residues (sugar/salts) keep absorbing moisture, causing:
- **Shorts** when you power on or charge  
- **Galvanic corrosion** under chips and keyboard membranes  
- **Stuck keys / trackpad faults** from swelling or residue  
- **Intermittent “ghost” problems** that show up days later

Every extra **power cycle** pushes current through wet areas and can turn a recoverable clean-up into a dead board. That’s why we recommend **power off and no charging** until a bench inspection.

---

## What not to do (seriously—skip these)

- **Don’t** keep turning it on “to check.”  
- **Don’t** charge it “to dry it out.” Charging accelerates corrosion.  
- **Don’t** put it in rice / an oven / on a heater / in the sun. Heat warps plastics and drives residue deeper.  
- **Don’t** shake it. You’ll drive liquid under keyboard layers and into speakers.  
- **Don’t** pry it open unless you know the model—tearing a battery cable can spark or puncture a swollen cell.

## The safer at-home routine (until you can get to us)

1. **Immediate power-down.** Hold the power button if necessary; unplug the charger.  
2. **Remove external bits.** USB drives, dongles, cards and cases. If your model has an **easy** removable battery, remove it.  
3. **Blot, then drain.** With the screen open, place the laptop in a **tent** (upside-down “V”) on a towel. Let gravity work.  
4. **Air, not heat.** Use room airflow (a fan across the desk helps). No hairdryers or heaters.  
5. **Book a diagnostic.** The goal is **internal cleaning** before corrosion starts.

If you absolutely must recover a file before you can visit, **do not log in and sync** (you’ll write to the wet drive). Ask us about **data-first imaging**.

## What we do on the bench (and why it helps)

- **Intake & triage.** We identify the liquid type (sugary/salty = urgent), check for shorts, and assess battery and power rails.  
- **Disassembly & cleaning.** We remove the board, keyboard/top-case and connectors; clean with appropriate solvents and controlled drying.  
- **Keyboard/trackpad assessment.** Membrane keyboards trap liquids—sometimes they recover; sometimes they need replacement.  
- **Data-first approach.** If the laptop **won’t boot** or storage seems unstable, we prioritise a **forensic-friendly image** of the drive before testing/repairs.  
- **Reassembly & verification.** We test power, thermals, keys, trackpad, display backlight and ports.

## Expectation setting (success odds, cost & timeline)

- **Same-day/next-day**: intake, cleaning, and power/keyboard tests for most spills.  
- **Costs** depend on severity and parts: light spills may only need cleaning; heavy spills often need a **keyboard/top-case** or **board** replacement. We’ll quote before ordering parts.  
- **Success rates** vary by liquid and delay. Clean water caught early fares best; sugary/acidic liquids degrade connectors quickly.  
- **Data-first** adds safety: if we image your drive before testing, your files are protected even if a board fails later.

---

## Myths vs reality

- **“It booted after rice; I’m fine.”** Hidden residue can corrode for weeks—back up and book a clean.  
- **“Alcohol everywhere fixes it.”** Wrong solvent/type can damage coatings and draw residue under BGA chips—bench cleaning is controlled for a reason.  
- **“I’ll just keep charging.”** That’s how boards get hot spots and permanent shorts.

---

## When to bring it in immediately

- **Sugary/salty liquids** (coffee, soda, juice, sea water).  
- **Charging failure**, burning smell, or visible **corrosion**.  
- **No boot**, **random shutdowns**, dead keys/trackpad after a spill.  
- **Laptop was on when it got wet** and you couldn’t power it down quickly.

Bring the **charger** and tell us **what spilled** and **when**. This speeds the correct cleaning process.

## Paperwork & privacy

You’ll receive a written diagnostic outcome and quote. If we handle your storage for backup or recovery, we follow POPIA-aligned practices: limited technician access and secure handling.

- Need a fast check-in? Mention **“liquid damage”** on the form and the time of spill.  
- Prefer to chat first? Call **066 425 6314** or **[Contact us](/contact/)**.

  title: "Quick Wi-Fi fixes to try before booking pro help"
  steps:
    - "Restart your router/ONT and wait 2–3 minutes for fibre reconnection."
    - "Move the router to a central, elevated spot away from microwaves or metal objects."
    - "Split 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands if older devices can’t stay connected."
    - "Run a speed test next to the router and again in the furthest room."
    - "If speeds drop sharply, consider a mesh system or pro survey."
faq:
  - q: "Why is Wi-Fi so slow in Stellenbosch student residences?"
    a: "Overloaded routers, poor placement, and shared bandwidth across many users are common causes."
  - q: "Do guesthouses need mesh Wi-Fi?"
    a: "Yes if you want consistent coverage in multiple rooms/outbuildings. Single routers rarely cover guesthouses fully."
  - q: "Can I fix Wi-Fi myself?"
    a: "You can restart, reposition, and change channels. For coverage or fibre/router issues, a pro setup is faster."
  - q: "What does a mesh install cost?"
    a: "Mesh kits start around R3,000; pro planning ensures best placement and value."
  - q: "Can Digissential optimise both student digs and guesthouses?"
    a: "Yes. We design Wi-Fi for residences, multi-floor houses, and commercial guesthouses — OHS and POPIA compliant."

> **TL;DR:** Stellenbosch students and guesthouses rely on Wi-Fi for **Zoom classes** and **Netflix nights**. If it’s slow or unstable, try quick fixes below — and if coverage still fails, Digissential designs **mesh/pro setups** that just work.

## Why Wi-Fi is tricky in Stellenbosch
- **Student digs:** cheap routers struggle with multiple devices.  
- **Guesthouses:** thick walls and spread-out rooms cause dead zones.  
- **Fibre swaps:** new ONTs/routers often misconfigured, leaving Wi-Fi weak.

## Quick fixes anyone can try
1. **Restart equipment** — router + fibre ONT.  
2. **Router placement** — central, high, away from microwaves/metal.  
3. **Band separation** — split 2.4 GHz (range) and 5 GHz (speed).  
4. **Speed tests** — measure near router vs far room.  
5. **Check load** — too many devices on a budget router = inevitable slowdowns.

## Mesh vs single router
- **Single router:** fine for flats/studios.  
- **Mesh Wi-Fi:** ideal for student houses, guesthouses, or outbuildings.  
- **Pro planning:** avoids overlap and ensures full coverage.

## When to call Digissential
- Wi-Fi drops during online classes or guest Netflix nights.  
- Signal dies in outbuildings, tasting rooms, or back bedrooms.  
- Router upgrades don’t fix coverage.

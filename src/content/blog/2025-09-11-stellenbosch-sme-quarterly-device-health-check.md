  title: "Quarterly device health check — what SMEs should do"
  steps:

    - "Run a speed-up/tune-up to remove bloat, check fans, and clear dust."
    - "Test backups with a restore drill to confirm files recover correctly."
    - "Verify Wi-Fi/router firmware and network stability."
    - "Record results in a compliance log for CPA/POPIA/OHS readiness."
faq:
  - q: "Why quarterly and not yearly?"
    a: "Four times a year matches business cycles — issues are caught early before they cause downtime during critical periods."
  - q: "How much downtime can this save?"
    a: "Preventive checks reduce surprise failures. Even one avoided day of outage often saves more than a year of health checks."
  - q: "Can this be done remotely?"
    a: "Yes. Many checks run via Remote Support. On-site visits are for physical cleaning, dust removal, or part swaps."
  - q: "Is there a warranty benefit?"

> **TL;DR:** With **Technopark’s SME cluster** running thousands of devices, downtime is expensive. Quarterly health checks from Digissential prevent failures, save costs, and keep your IT **CPA/POPIA-compliant**.

## Why SMEs can’t skip maintenance
- **Hidden costs:** emergency downtime costs staff hours, lost sales, and reputational harm.  
- **Student-style neglect:** many SMEs delay maintenance until failure, paying more in recovery fees.  
- **Compliance edge:** CPA, POPIA, and OHS documentation show clients and auditors you’re proactive.

## Quarterly vs reactive repairs
- **Quarterly:** proactive tune-ups, backups verified, and dust cleared.  
- **Reactive:** expensive rush repairs, lost productivity, missed deadlines.  

One SME laptop failure in Technopark can waste a full day of staff time. Multiply that across a team, and health checks pay for themselves.

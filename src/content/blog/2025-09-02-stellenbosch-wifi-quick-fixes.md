  title: "Safe quick checks for residence/apartment Wi-Fi"
  steps:
    - "Place the router high with clear line of sight; avoid cupboards, metal, mirrors and microwaves."
    - "Use 5 GHz for speed nearby; keep 2.4 GHz (20 MHz width) for range/older devices."
    - "Pick clean channels: 2.4 GHz → 1, 6 or 11; 5 GHz → 36–48 or 149–165 (try 80 MHz width, drop to 40 MHz if congested)."
    - "Name SSIDs clearly (e.g., MyFlat-2G / MyFlat-5G), set WPA2/3 password, and disable WPS."
    - "If Zoom still stutters, test with Ethernet or a USB-C LAN adapter; if that fixes it, book a remote tune-up or plan mesh."
faq:
  - q: "Why is Wi-Fi worse at night in residences?"
    a: "More neighbours are online, crowding 2.4 GHz. Use 5 GHz when possible, lock 2.4 GHz to channel 1/6/11 at 20 MHz, and move the router higher with clear sight lines."
  - q: "Should I use 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz?"
    a: "Use 5 GHz for laptops/phones near the router (faster, less interference). Use 2.4 GHz for reach or IoT. Separate SSIDs let you choose per device."
  - q: "‘Connected, no internet’—is it the ISP?"
    a: "Test Ethernet or a phone hotspot. If Ethernet is stable but Wi-Fi drops, it’s local wireless (placement/channel). If both fail, log a fault with your ISP."
  - q: "Can you tune this remotely?"
    a: "Yes. We set channels/widths, rename SSIDs and improve security in a remote session. Book a [Remote support session](/services/remote-support-setup/)."
  - q: "Do you install mesh systems?"
    a: "Yes. We plan node placement/backhaul and SSID strategy for small flats to multi-room homes. See [Mesh Wi-Fi planning](/services/mesh-wifi-planning-install/)."

> **TL;DR:** Most residence Wi-Fi issues are **placement + band + channel width**. Put the router **high** with line of sight, use **5 GHz** for speed, **2.4 GHz @ 20 MHz** for reach, and pick clean channels. If Zoom still stutters, try **Ethernet**; if that works, book a **remote tune-up** or plan a **mesh**.

## What you’ll learn
- The three big levers: **placement**, **2.4 vs 5 GHz**, and **channels/width**.  
- A quick way to tell **Wi-Fi vs ISP** problems apart.  
- Student-friendly tweaks for **Zoom/Teams** calls.  
- When to book a **remote tune-up** or install **mesh Wi-Fi**.

---

## 1) Placement: free performance
Wi-Fi hates obstacles. The more walls, metal and mirrors between you and the router, the worse the signal.

- **Height & sight:** shelf or wall-mount, not in a cupboard/on the floor.  
- **Antenna angles:** spread external antennas (one vertical, others ~45–60°).  
- **Avoid interference:** keep 1–2 m away from microwaves, cordless bases, big fridges and mirrors.  
- **One SSID per flat (ideally):** too many SSIDs confuse devices; if you have multiple APs, use the same SSID/pass with non-overlapping channels.

---

## 2) Bands & width: pick the right lane

### 2.4 GHz (range)
- Best for **through-walls** and legacy devices.  
- Channels **1, 6 or 11 only**.  
- **20 MHz width** keeps overlap down.

### 5 GHz (speed)
- Faster/cleaner air; shorter range.  
- Use **36–48** or **149–165**.  
- **80 MHz width** near the router; drop to **40 MHz** if congested or if your router struggles.

**Pro tip:** Separate SSIDs (e.g., `MyFlat-2G` / `MyFlat-5G`) so you can choose the best band per device.

---

## 3) Zoom/Teams stability checklist

- Prefer **5 GHz**, sit closer to the router.  
- **Ethernet beats Wi-Fi**—a cheap USB-C/USB-A adapter can save an exam.  
- Pause heavy downloads/syncs; close cloud upload jobs.  
- Use **headphones**; enable noise suppression.  
- If **Ethernet is perfect** but Wi-Fi lags, the fix is placement/channels/width, not your ISP.

---

## 4) Router basics that help

- **Reboot once** after changes; don’t power-cycle endlessly.  
- **Update firmware** from the admin page/app.  
- **Rename SSIDs** and **disable WPS**; use **WPA2-PSK/WPA3-SAE**.  
- **Strong passphrase** (12+ chars).  
- **Screenshot settings** so you can redo them after a reset.

Need a hand? Book a **[Remote support session](/services/remote-support-setup/)**.

## 5) Is it Wi-Fi or the ISP?

1. **Test Ethernet** to the router.  
   - If Ethernet is solid but Wi-Fi isn’t → **wireless** issue.  
   - If Ethernet also drops → call your **ISP**.  
2. **Try a phone hotspot** briefly; if calls are perfect, your flat Wi-Fi or ISP link is the culprit.  
3. **Check router logs/lights** for line drops or re-syncs.

We can help **collect evidence** and escalate to the ISP.

## 6) When to install mesh (and how to do it right)

- Use **mesh** for multi-room coverage.  
- Place nodes **one wall apart**; good signal **between nodes** matters most.  
- Prefer **wired backhaul** (Ethernet/powerline if clean); otherwise keep nodes in **line of sight**.  
- Keep **one SSID** across nodes; avoid double NAT by bridging the ISP router where possible.

Plan it with us: **[Wi-Fi/Network setup](/services/wifi-network-setup/)** or **[Mesh Wi-Fi planning](/services/mesh-wifi-planning-install/)**.

---

## 7) Quick outcomes we can deliver remotely

- Read the local **spectrum**, choose cleaner channels/widths.  
- Rename SSIDs and improve security (WPA2/3, no WPS).  
- Optimise **Zoom/Teams** device settings.  
- Document a **backup Ethernet plan** for exams/interviews.

## Final word

Most Stellenbosch Wi-Fi problems don’t need a new ISP—just the **right band, cleaner channels and better placement**. Try the checks above; if calls still stutter, we’ll tune it remotely or design a simple mesh.

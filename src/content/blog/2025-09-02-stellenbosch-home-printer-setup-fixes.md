  title: "Printer setup that actually works (quick steps)"
  steps:
    - "Decide the connection: **USB for reliability**, **Wi-Fi** for convenience. If Wi-Fi is flaky, start USB, then add Wi-Fi once stable."
    - "Place it right: same room as the laptop, **line of sight** to the router for first setup; avoid cupboards and microwaves."
    - "Install the **full driver** (not just a generic app). Only keep one brand suite—uninstall old manufacturer suites first."
    - "Add the printer: Windows → Settings > Bluetooth & devices > Printers; macOS → System Settings > Printers & Scanners; prefer **IP** add if auto-discovery fails."
    - "Set sensible defaults: **Duplex on**, **grayscale** for drafts, A4, borderless off (ink saver). Save as **device defaults**."
    - "If jobs hang: clear queue; restart **Print Spooler** (Windows Services) or remove/re-add the printer; power-cycle the printer once."
faq:
  - q: "Should I use the brand app or the driver?"
    a: "Install the full driver first for reliability. Use the brand app only for scanning/maintenance; avoid running multiple vendor suites at once."
  - q: "Wi-Fi or USB—what’s best?"
    a: "USB is the most reliable. Wi-Fi is fine if the router is nearby and on 5 GHz. For first setup, USB avoids discovery issues."
  - q: "Why does duplex/grayscale save so much?"
    a: "Automatic **two-sided** + **grayscale** for drafts halves paper use and cuts expensive colour ink—set these as device defaults once."
  - q: "Cheap third-party inks—worth it?"
    a: "Sometimes, but poor cartridges clog heads and waste ink on cleans. If you try them, buy reputable brands and print a page weekly."
  - q: "Can you fix this remotely?"
    a: "Yes. We remove conflicting drivers, add the device by IP, set sane defaults and test scan/print via a **remote session**."

> **TL;DR:** Use **USB for setup** (add Wi-Fi later if you want). Install the **full driver**, not just the lite app. Set **duplex + grayscale** as defaults, and if the queue jams, **restart the Spooler** and re-add the printer.

## Driver vs app (and why it matters)
- **Full driver package** exposes paper sizes, duplex, quality modes and maintenance (cleaning, alignment).  
- Brand “smart” apps are fine for scanning and quick prints, but they don’t replace proper drivers—and multiple suites from different brands **conflict**.  
**Fix:** Uninstall old vendor suites, reboot, then install the correct driver for your exact model.

## Wi-Fi vs USB: pick your battles
- **USB** = stable, low-friction setup; great for exam-week hand-ins.  
- **Wi-Fi** = flexible, but sensitive to placement and channels. Keep the printer **in the same room** as the router if possible; prefer **5 GHz**; avoid 40 MHz on a congested 2.4 GHz.  
- For first-time setup, plug in **USB**, add the printer, print a test page, then add the **network** queue.

## Fast wins that stop waste
- **Default duplex** + **grayscale** for drafts; switch to colour/photo only when needed.  
- **Paper profile**: choose the exact media (plain/photo/matte) to avoid over-inking and smears.  
- **Weekly keep-alive**: one page per week prevents clogs on inkjets.  
- **Update firmware** and drivers quarterly; some brands fix Wi-Fi sleep bugs in updates.

## Stuck print queue? Try this order
1) **Cancel all** jobs in the queue.  
2) Windows: open **Services**, restart **Print Spooler**; macOS: delete and re-add the printer.  
3) Power-cycle the printer and router once.  
4) Re-add the printer by **IP** if auto-discovery keeps failing.  
Still broken? We’ll sort it in a **remote session**.

## Scanning that just works
- Install the vendor **scan utility** (or Windows Scan / macOS Image Capture).  
- Save as **PDF** (text) or **JPEG** (photos).  
- For multi-page PDFs, use the vendor app or Microsoft Print to PDF.

## When to call in help (common pain points)
- Printer sleeps and never wakes on Wi-Fi; jobs vanish.  
- Endless “Copy 1/USB/WS” duplicates in Windows.  
- macOS shows the device but can’t scan.  
- Duplex prints on the long edge when you wanted short edge.  
- Colours washed out on photo paper (wrong media profile).

We fix these fast with a remote tune-up, then save **duplex + grayscale** as your device defaults.

## Notes for students in shared flats
- Put the printer on **5 GHz** with a simple SSID/password and share it from one laptop if the model is basic.  
- Keep a **USB cable** in the drawer for emergencies.  
- If your Wi-Fi is flaky, see our **[Wi-Fi quick fixes](/blog/stellenbosch-wifi-quick-fixes/)**.

## Final word
Most printer pain is **driver choice + connection method + sane defaults**. Start USB, install the proper driver, enable duplex/grayscale, and you’ll stop wasting ink and paper. If it still misbehaves, we can fix it **remotely** and lock in reliable settings for good.

  steps:
    - "Confirm model/specs: CPU, RAM, storage, screen size/resolution match the listing (About/Settings and device label)."
    - "Battery health: On macOS check cycle count and condition in System Information → Power; on Windows run `powercfg /batteryreport`. High cycles + ‘Service/Replace soon’ = negotiate or budget for a swap."
    - "SSD/HDD SMART: Use a vendor tool or CrystalDiskInfo; any ‘Caution/Bad’, reallocated/pending sectors, or high NVMe media wear = walk away or plan an SSD replacement."
    - "Screen test: Full-white/black/red/green/blue images to spot dead pixels, light bleed and lines; tilt lid to check cable flicker."
    - "Keyboard/trackpad & I/O: Test all keys, trackpad click, webcam/mic/speakers, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth, USB-A/C, HDMI/DP, SD reader, headphone jack."
    - "Charger & ports: Use the correct wattage OEM charger; on USB-C machines verify it charges at the expected wattage and that both sides’ ports work."
    - "Activation/locks: Windows—signed out of previous Microsoft account and ‘Activation: Windows is activated’; macOS—sign out of Apple ID, **Find My off**, no MDM profiles."
    - "Thermals & fans: Under light load check temps/fan noise; excessive heat or loud fans suggest dust or dried paste."
    - "Storage & OS sanity: Ensure clean install, no trialware bloat; verify bit-locker/FileVault keys provided or disabled before handover."
    - "Paperwork: Serial/IMEI on invoice, warranty length, returns process and a brief ‘fit for purpose’ note (e.g., “suitable for Office/Zoom/Lightroom)."
faq:
  - q: "What does the CPA mean for refurbished or second-hand laptops?"
    a: "The SA Consumer Protection Act still protects you: goods must be reasonably durable and **fit for purpose** as described. A seller may offer a shorter warranty on used goods, but defects present at sale remain their responsibility."
  - q: "How long is the warranty on a used laptop?"
    a: "Varies by seller; 3–6 months is common. You should still get a workable remedy for latent defects under CPA. Ensure the term is written on the invoice."
  - q: "Is a high battery cycle count a deal-breaker?"
    a: "Not always. Expect reduced runtime above ±500–800 cycles on many notebooks. Budget **R900–R2 200** for common Windows packs and **R1 600–R3 500** for many MacBook packs (model-dependent)."
  - q: "How do I check SSD life on the spot?"
    a: "Open a SMART tool and read ‘Health/Media wear’. Any ‘Caution/Bad’, lots of reallocated sectors, or NVMe wear nearing limits—either replace the drive or skip the unit."
  - q: "Can you pre-test a unit before I buy?"
    a: "Yes. We can run a same/next-day pre-purchase diagnostic, note battery cycles and SMART health, and give you a short report with go/no-go advice."

> **TL;DR:** Match the **specs to the listing**, check **battery cycles** and **SSD SMART**, run a simple **screen/keyboard/port** test, and make sure the invoice lists the **serial + warranty** and a **fit-for-purpose** note. We can pre-test and set it up for you.

## What to check (Stellenbosch-savvy)

### 1) Battery: cycles & condition
- **macOS:**  → System Settings → General → System Report → **Power** → *Cycle Count* / *Condition*.  
- **Windows:** `powercfg /batteryreport` (Command Prompt as admin), or OEM utility.  
If runtime matters (classes/edits), treat a tired pack as a consumable and negotiate.

### 2) Storage: SMART health
Open a SMART utility. **Walk away** from drives showing *Caution/Bad*, many reallocated/pending sectors, or NVMe media wear near end-of-life. Factor an SSD swap into price if needed.

### 3) Screen & cable
Show solid colours + white/black to reveal **dead pixels** or **bleed**. If the display flickers when you change lid angle, the **display cable/hinge loom** may be worn.

### 4) Keyboard/trackpad, webcam & audio
Try every key, trackpad click/gestures, webcam/mic, speakers and **all ports** (USB-A/C, HDMI/DP, card reader, headphone jack). Test **Wi-Fi/Bluetooth** briefly.

### 5) Charger & power budget
Confirm **OEM wattage** (e.g., 65 W/90 W). Under-rated or off-brand bricks cause throttling and battery drain while plugged in—budget for the correct adapter if missing.

### 6) Activation & locks (don’t skip)
- **Windows:** “Windows is **activated**”; previous user fully signed out; BitLocker either off or recovery key provided.  
- **macOS:** **Find My** off; signed out of Apple ID; no **MDM** profiles; Activation Lock removed.  
No locks? Good. If locked, request a clean handover before paying.

### 7) Thermals & fans
Warm is normal; **searing heat or grinding fans** hint at dust or paste that needs service. Not a deal-breaker—just budget a tune-up.

### 8) Invoice must-haves (CPA-aware)
- Seller **name/reg/VAT** (if registered) & contact details  
- **Date**, **serial number**, model/spec summary  
- **Warranty term** (e.g., 3/6 months) and who to contact for claims  
- **Returns/repair** process  
- A short **fit-for-purpose** note matching your stated use (e.g., “Office, Teams/Zoom, 1080p edits”)—this anchors CPA expectations

> Buying for editing or engineering? Tell the seller. Under **CPA**, if they confirm suitability, it should be **fit for that purpose**.

## Final pre-buy checklist (copy/paste)

- ✅ Specs match listing (CPU/RAM/SSD/screen)  
- ✅ Battery cycles & condition acceptable  
- ✅ SSD/HDD SMART **Good**  
- ✅ Screen, keys, ports, Wi-Fi/BT OK  
- ✅ Correct OEM charger included  
- ✅ No activation locks (Windows/macOS)  
- ✅ Invoice shows **serial + warranty + fit-for-purpose**

If any line fails, negotiate—or let us run a **same/next-day pre-test** so you buy with confidence in **Stellenbosch**.

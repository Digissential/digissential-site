> **TL;DR:** Stellenbosch SMEs — especially in **Technopark** — rely on fast, safe, and compliant IT support. Digissential’s on-site visits follow OHS rules, POPIA data handling, and CPA warranty protections.

## Why safe on-site IT support matters
- **SMEs can’t afford downtime** — every day without IT = lost revenue.  
- **Untrained technicians create risk** — electrical, fire, or data mishandling.  
- **Compliance is non-negotiable** — OHS, POPIA, and CPA protect both client and provider.

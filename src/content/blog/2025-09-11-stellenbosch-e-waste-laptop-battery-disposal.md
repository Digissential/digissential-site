> **TL;DR:** Stellenbosch produces high volumes of e-waste from **student turnover** and **SME device refresh cycles**. Under **NEM:WA**, laptops and batteries are hazardous — Digissential disposes of them lawfully and wipes your data with CoDD proof.

## Why safe disposal matters
- **Lithium fire risk:** swollen or punctured cells ignite easily.  
- **POPIA data risk:** old drives often hold coursework, IDs, invoices, client data.  
- **Legal duty:** the National Environmental Management: Waste Act (NEM:WA) bans e-waste in landfills.

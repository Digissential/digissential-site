  title: "Survey & plan Wi-Fi for Stellenbosch outbuildings"
  steps:
    - "Check distances: mesh is fine for 20–30m indoors; beyond that, survey for point-to-point."
    - "Look for line-of-sight between main building and outbuildings."
    - "Place access points high and central; avoid thick walls and trees."
    - "Test with a temporary AP or bridge before committing to installation."
    - "Book Digissential for a site visit if coverage gaps remain."
faq:
  - q: "What’s the difference between mesh and point-to-point Wi-Fi?"
    a: "Mesh extends coverage by adding nodes indoors. Point-to-point uses directional antennas to link separate buildings over distance."
  - q: "When does mesh Wi-Fi fail?"
    a: "Mesh struggles across thick farm walls or long distances (>30m). In those cases, point-to-point is more reliable."
  - q: "How far can point-to-point Wi-Fi go?"
    a: "With line-of-sight, 200m–2km is possible. Ideal for wine farms with distant cottages or offices."
  - q: "What does a site visit involve?"
    a: "Digissential checks line-of-sight, measures signal strength, and plans AP placement before quoting."
  - q: "How much does it cost?"
    a: "Mesh kits: R3,000–R6,000. Point-to-point links: R4,500–R9,000. On-site survey fee applies."

> **TL;DR:** Stellenbosch wine farms and guesthouses often need more than mesh Wi-Fi. For outbuildings beyond 30m, a point-to-point link is the reliable choice. Digissential surveys, installs, and supports both.

## Why Wi-Fi in outbuildings is tricky

Stellenbosch estates and guesthouses often face:
- **Mesh struggles** across thick farm walls.  
- **Signal drop** beyond 20–30m, especially outdoors.  
- **Guests** frustrated with poor Wi-Fi in cottages.  
- **POS systems** in tasting rooms dropping due to weak coverage.

## Mesh vs point-to-point

### Mesh Wi-Fi
- **Good for:** Multiple rooms in one building, short distances (<30m).  
- **Limitations:** Weak across stone walls, unstable outdoors.  

### Point-to-Point Wi-Fi
- **Good for:** Outbuildings, cottages, or tasting rooms with clear line-of-sight.  
- **Capabilities:** 200m–2km stable links.  
- **Requirement:** Mount antennas high, align carefully.

## Basic survey steps

1. **Measure distance** from main router to outbuildings.  
2. **Check line-of-sight** — avoid trees, vines, or hills blocking signal.  
3. **Place access points high & central** inside buildings.  
4. **Temporary test** with a spare AP or bridge before final install.  
5. **Book on-site visit** for professional assessment and quoting.

## Realistic costs (ZAR)

- **Mesh kits (3-node):** R3,000–R6,000.  
- **Point-to-point links:** R4,500–R9,000 depending on range/gear.  
- **On-site survey:** R300 + R8/km travel (see [On-Site Surcharge](/legal/standard-fees/)).  
- **Remote support config:** from R350/hr.

faq:
  - q: "What e-waste do you accept?"
    a: "Laptops, desktops, small servers, drives, phones, tablets, routers, chargers, cables, monitors, printers and accessories. Ask first for very large items."
  - q: "How do you protect my data?"
    a: "We wipe or destroy storage media. On request we issue a **Certificate of Data Destruction (CoDD)** after verified wipe or physical destruction."
  - q: "Can I drop off swollen or damaged batteries?"
    a: "Yes, but **don’t puncture or bend** them. Tape the terminals, place each in a clear bag or box, and bring them directly—no curbside bins."
  - q: "Do you collect?"
    a: "Collection around Stellenbosch can be arranged; availability depends on workload. Mention it on [/contact/](/contact/)."
  - q: "Do I need to remove my accounts first?"
    a: "Sign out of iCloud/Google/Microsoft where possible to avoid activation locks. If not, we can still process the device and wipe storage."

> **TL;DR:** Don’t bin old tech. Drop it at a responsible e-waste point where storage is **wiped or destroyed** and batteries are handled safely. We accept most small electronics, can issue **CoDD** on request, and help with POPIA-aligned handling.

## What counts as e-waste (and what we take)

We accept the majority of **small to medium** devices typically found in student flats and SMEs:

- **Computers & parts:** laptops, desktops, mini-PCs, RAM, GPUs, PSUs, motherboards  
- **Storage:** HDDs/SSDs, external drives, USB sticks, memory cards  
- **Mobiles & tablets:** phones, tablets, smart watches  
- **Networking:** routers, mesh nodes, switches, LTE/5G modems  
- **Peripherals:** monitors, printers/scanners, docks, chargers, cables, mice/keyboards, webcams  
- **Power gear:** UPS units and adapters (please remove loose batteries if possible)

If you’re unsure about a **very large** item (large copier, server rack, CRT display), ask first via [/contact/](/contact/).

## Batteries: the safe way to dispose (especially swollen Li-ion)

Lithium-ion cells are recyclable, but they’re also a **fire risk** when bent, punctured or tossed into general bins.

**Do this:**
- **Power down** the device. If the battery is swollen, **avoid pressing** on the case.  
- **Isolate terminals** with tape (electrical/insulation). For loose cells, put each in a **separate clear bag** or small box.  
- **Transport flat**, not in a pocket or tight backpack.  
- **Bring directly** to us or a qualified drop-off—**never curbside bins**.

**Don’t do this:**
- Don’t **pierce** a swollen pack to “deflate” it.  
- Don’t throw Li-ion into general refuse or skip bins.  
- Don’t ship damaged packs by courier without declaration and proper packaging.

## Your data: wipe requirements, POPIA and CoDD

Under **POPIA**, you’re responsible for the personal information on devices you retire. We follow a “**image or wipe before exit**” approach:

1. **Intake & ID** – device logged with serial/asset tag.  
2. **Verified wipe** – NIST-aligned software wipe for HDD/SSD where healthy.  
3. **CoDD on request** – we issue a **Certificate of Data Destruction** confirming method (software wipe or physical shredding/punch).  
4. **Exceptions** – if a drive is unreadable, we **physically destroy** it and document the method.  
5. **Chain of custody** – devices are stored in a controlled area until processed.

Need the policy details? See our **E-waste Policy** → [/legal/ewaste-disposal/](/legal/ewaste-disposal/)  
Need a certificate for audit? Request **CoDD** → [/services/certified-wipe/](/services/certified-wipe/)

## Responsible routes in Stellenbosch

- **Drop-off with us** – quickest for laptops, drives, phones and small gear.  
- **Collection** – available by arrangement (residences, offices).  
- **Large/odd items** – we’ll guide you to the right recycler partner.

We separate **hazardous** components (batteries, lamps), recover **reusables** (RAM/drives when appropriate), and send the rest to accredited recycling streams. Consumer devices that still work may be **sanitised and donated** where suitable (with your consent).

## Before you drop: quick prep checklist

- **Sign out** of iCloud/Google/Microsoft (prevents activation locks).  
- **Remove SIM cards** and microSD cards if you need them.  
- **Include power supplies** for laptops/routers if available.  
- **Label** anything that must be returned (e.g., drive caddies).  
- **Back up** important files if the device is still functional.

## Fees & timing

Most small e-waste drop-offs are **free**; special handling may apply for **large batteries/UPS packs** or **on-site collection**. We’ll confirm at check-in. CoDD issuance is included when you book **Certified Wipe**.

---

## How we handle displays, printers and UPS units

- **Monitors/TVs:** modern LCD/LED accepted; very old **CRT** units may require directed disposal—ask first.  
- **Printers:** remove ink/toner where possible; we can take standard home/SME models.  
- **UPS:** bring the unit; we’ll remove and process the internal batteries safely.

## Why proper e-waste matters

Electronics contain **valuable materials** (aluminium, copper, gold) and **hazardous** ones (lead, mercury, lithium). Recycling reduces mining and prevents **landfill fires** from damaged batteries. Equally important, **secure data handling** protects you under POPIA and avoids identity fraud.

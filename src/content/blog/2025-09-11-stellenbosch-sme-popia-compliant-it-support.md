> **TL;DR:** Stellenbosch SMEs — especially in **Technopark** and the 2,500+ businesses within 20 km — need IT support that’s **POPIA-compliant**. Digissential delivers secure setups, backups, and certified data destruction with proof for audits.

## Why compliance is now a business edge
- Clients demand **proof of data protection** before contracts.  
- POPIA fines = up to R10m, reputational harm even worse.  
- SMEs can’t afford downtime from ransomware or data loss.  

With 2,500 SMEs in Stellenbosch’s orbit, compliance isn’t optional — it’s a trust signal.

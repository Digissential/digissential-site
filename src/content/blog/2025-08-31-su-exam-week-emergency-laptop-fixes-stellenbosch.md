> **TL;DR:** During SU exam weeks we prioritise **same-day triage and fixes**. No-boot Windows, dead chargers, and many battery jobs can be turned around today. Screens are **next-day if in stock**, longer if we must order the exact panel. Pickup/drop-off in Stellenbosch is available by arrangement.

## What we can usually do **today**

- **No-boot / stuck Windows**  
  We run a fast diagnostic and, if the drive is healthy, perform a **clean reinstall with backup** the same day.  
  → [Book a diagnostic](/services/diagnostic-in-shop/) · [Windows reinstall with backup](/services/windows-reinstall-with-backup/)

- **Dead / missing charger**  
  Quick test with a bench PSU to confirm it’s not the port or board. If it’s just the charger, we’ll advise a compatible replacement.

- **Battery dying fast / random shutdowns**  
  If your model’s battery is **in stock**, we can swap it **same-day** (many mainstream laptops) or **next-day**.  
  → [Battery replacement](/services/battery-replacement-labour/)

- **Slow, freezing, pop-ups**  
  Same-day **malware cleanup/tune-up** if it boots; remote help is possible if you’re on campus Wi-Fi.

- **Hinge screws, keycaps, fan clean, RAM/SSD swap**  
  Quick bench fixes where parts are on hand. We’ll confirm time after intake.

## What’s **next-day** or 2–4 days

- **Cracked screen / no backlight / lines**  
  If we have your exact panel, it’s often **next-day**. Special panels (touch/high-res/OLED) are **2–4 working days** for courier stock.  
  → [Laptop screen replacement](/services/laptop-screen-replacement-labour/)

- **Rare batteries, keyboards, palm-rest assemblies**  
  Some ultrabooks and Mac models require full top-case parts. We’ll quote and give you an ETA up front.

- **Board-level or liquid damage**  
  Needs assessment and controlled cleaning/imaging. Timing depends on severity.

## How exam-week triage works

1) **Intake & quick tests (10–20 min).** Power, storage S.M.A.R.T., memory, thermals.  
2) **Go/no-go decision.** If it’s a software fault, we proceed immediately; if hardware, we confirm parts & ETA.  
3) **Same-day fixes** where possible; otherwise **loaned keyboard/mouse/PSU** suggestions to keep you working while parts arrive.  
4) **Updates as we go**—we’ll text you the plan and pickup time.

## If you’re on the way to us (safe steps)

- **Back up the most important folder** to cloud/USB if the laptop still boots.  
- **Don’t keep power-cycling** a machine that won’t start or that makes clicking sounds.  
- **Bring the charger** (we test with it), and note any **error messages** or spills/drops.  
- **Remove accessories** (dongles, SD cards) and keep the bag light—screens crack easily when squeezed.

## Pickup / drop-off near campus

Short on time? We can **collect and return** in Stellenbosch **by arrangement**. It’s ideal for diagnostics, Windows reinstalls and many battery jobs.  
→ [Arrange pickup/drop-off](/contact/)

## Transparent expectations & student-friendly pricing

- **Diagnostics** are same-day in most cases; you’ll get a written quote before any spend.  
- **Batteries**: many swaps are same/next-day if in stock; price depends on model and cell quality (OEM vs compatible).  
- **Screens**: next-day if in stock; special-order panels are **2–4 working days**.  
- **No surprise charges**—we’ll call before ordering anything.

### FAQs

**Do you offer loaners?**  
We don’t supply loan laptops, but we’ll help you keep working (e.g., external keyboard/mouse or USB-C Ethernet for stable Zoom during repairs).

**Can you save my files if Windows won’t start?**  
Often, yes. We prioritise a safe backup before any reinstall when the drive is readable. If the drive is failing, we’ll discuss recovery options first.

**What time should I drop off?**  
Earlier is better for **same-day** outcomes. We’ll confirm by text once the bench allocation is set.

**Do you repair on weekends?**  
Limited slots—contact us to check availability during exam weekends.

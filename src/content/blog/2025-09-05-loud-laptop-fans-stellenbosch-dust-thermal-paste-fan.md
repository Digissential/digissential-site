  title: "Quick triage for loud laptop fans"
  steps:
    - "Shut down and place the laptop on a hard, flat surface."
    - "Blow dust gently from vents with compressed air (short bursts only)."
    - "Check CPU/GPU temps with free monitoring tools."
    - "If noise persists, book a **Thermal Paste & Deep Clean** for full disassembly."
    - "If grinding noises continue, request a fan replacement."
faq:
  - q: "Why is my laptop fan so loud?"
    a: "Dust buildup, dried thermal paste, or a failing fan can all make laptops run louder. Overheating is a common side effect."
  - q: "Can I clean the fan myself?"
    a: "You can blow dust from vents with compressed air, but full cleaning and thermal paste replacement should be left to professionals."
  - q: "How much does fan or paste service cost?"
    a: "Thermal paste service starts at R350; full deep clean + paste at R650; fan replacement labour at R450 (part separate)."
  - q: "Will loud fans damage my laptop?"
    a: "Yes. Persistent overheating reduces component lifespan and can cause shutdowns or data loss."
  - q: "How long is the turnaround?"
    a: "Same-day for cleaning; 1–2 days for repaste or fan replacement if parts are available."

> **TL;DR:** Loud laptop fans in Stellenbosch usually mean **dust buildup, dried thermal paste, or a failing fan**. Clean vents first. If noise persists, book a professional deep clean, repaste, or fan replacement.

## Why laptops get noisy in Stellenbosch

With Cape Town’s heat and Stellenbosch dust, laptops often show:
- **Constant whirring** — fans running high even during light use.  
- **Overheating** — keyboard area gets hot, device shuts down randomly.  
- **Grinding/rattling** — mechanical fan failure.  

Each symptom points to a different root cause.

## Signs & safe triage

### 1. Dust buildup
- **Signs:** Loud airflow, hot exhaust, stable temps but constant fan noise.  
- **DIY:** Blow dust out with compressed air (short bursts, don’t tilt the can).  

### 2. Dried thermal paste
- **Signs:** Fans spin up quickly during light use, temps spike past 80°C, device throttles or lags.  
- **Fix:** Professional **Thermal Paste & Deep Clean**.  

### 3. Failing fan
- **Signs:** Grinding/rattling noises, fan stalls, laptop overheats and shuts down.  
- **Fix:** Full fan replacement (labour + part).

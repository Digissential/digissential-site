howTo:
  title: "New-laptop setup that just works (do these in order)"
  steps:
    - "Run system updates: Windows → Settings > Windows Update; macOS → System Settings > Software Update. Reboot once updates finish."
    - "Turn on protection: Windows Security (or your chosen AV), enable firewall; on macOS keep XProtect/Gatekeeper on. Avoid running two AVs."
    - "Map cloud folders: sign into OneDrive/Google Drive; enable Desktop/Documents/Pictures sync. Create a test file and confirm it appears on your phone."
    - "Privacy basics: browser → block third-party cookies, review extensions, set a strong password manager and enable MFA for email."
    - "Residence Wi-Fi: place router high with line of sight; use 5 GHz for speed, 2.4 GHz @ 20 MHz for reach. Choose channels 1/6/11 (2.4) or 36–48/149–165 (5)."
    - "Fail-safes: create a restore point (Windows) or make a Time Machine backup (macOS); note recovery codes for your accounts."
faq:
  - q: "Can you set this up for me before classes?"
    a: "Yes—remotely or in-shop. We install updates, set AV, map OneDrive/Google Drive, and tune Wi-Fi. Book a session and we’ll do it step-by-step."
  - q: "Do I need antivirus beyond Windows Security?"
    a: "Windows Security is fine for most students if kept updated. The big wins are MFA, cautious extensions, and avoiding duplicate AV tools."
  - q: "My Wi-Fi in Idas Valley/Cloetesville rentals is flaky—help?"
    a: "Use 5 GHz near the router, 2.4 GHz for reach; fix the channel/width, and place the router high. We can tune this in a quick remote session."
  - q: "What if I’m moving from an old laptop?"
    a: "Back up first, then migrate profiles/files. We can clone or transfer and keep your old drive as a fallback."
  - q: "Will you keep my data private?"
    a: "Yes—POPIA-aware processes with least-privilege access. We can sign an NDA on request."

> **TL;DR:** Update first, protect with built-in AV + MFA, sync **OneDrive/Google Drive**, and place/choose **Wi-Fi** bands properly. Add a **restore point/Time Machine** and keep your recovery codes handy. If you’d like, we’ll set it all up **remotely** before classes start.

## What you’ll set up in 30–45 minutes

### 1) Updates & drivers (speed + stability)
- **Windows:** Settings → Windows Update → Check for updates (repeat until clear).  
- **macOS:** System Settings → General → Software Update.  
- Optional OEM tools (Dell/HP/Lenovo/ASUS) for chipset/storage firmware.

### 2) Protection that isn’t noisy
- **Windows Security** (Real-time + SmartScreen) or one reputable AV.  
- **Browser hygiene:** remove shady extensions; enable automatic updates.  
- **MFA everywhere:** email, cloud storage, and banking. Save **recovery codes**.

### 3) Cloud sync that actually restores
- Sign into **OneDrive/Google Drive**.  
- Redirect **Desktop/Documents/Pictures** to your cloud (Known Folder Move on OneDrive).  
- Do a **test file** to confirm sync on another device.  
- If you need a belt-and-braces copy, add a small **external backup** too.

### 4) Residence/apartment Wi-Fi that doesn’t lag
- **Placement:** router **high**, line of sight; avoid cupboards/microwaves/mirrors.  
- **Bands:** 5 GHz for your laptop/phone; keep 2.4 GHz (20 MHz width) for reach/IoT.  
- **Channels:** 1/6/11 on 2.4; 36–48 or 149–165 on 5 GHz.  
- **Zoom/Teams tip:** if calls still stutter, use **Ethernet** (USB-C adapter) during classes.

## Common pitfalls (and quick fixes)
- **Duplicate antivirus** → uninstall extras; one good tool beats two fighting.  
- **Only-cloud or only-external** → use **both** if you can.  
- **Printer chaos** → install the **full driver** for your model, then set **duplex + grayscale** by default.  
- **Squeezed lids** → don’t pack the laptop tight; it’s how screens crack in week one.

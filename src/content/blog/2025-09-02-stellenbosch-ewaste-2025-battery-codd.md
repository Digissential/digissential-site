faq:
  - q: "What e-waste do you accept?"
    a: "Laptops/desktops, drives (HDD/SSD), phones, tablets, routers, chargers, cables, monitors, printers and small peripherals. Ask first for very large or commercial gear."
  - q: "How do you protect my data?"
    a: "We perform a verified software wipe (NIST 800-88 r1 or device crypto-erase where supported). Unreadable media is physically destroyed. CoDD available on request."
  - q: "Can I drop off swollen or damaged batteries?"
    a: "Yes—tape terminals, place each cell in a separate clear bag/box, and bring directly (no curbside bins). Don’t pierce or bend swollen packs."
  - q: "Do you collect around Stellenbosch?"
    a: "Pickup/drop-off can be arranged subject to availability. Mention it on [Contact us](/contact/)."
  - q: "Is there a cost?"
    a: "Most small e-waste is free to drop off. Special handling (large UPS packs/on-site collection) may carry a fee; we’ll confirm at check-in."

> **TL;DR:** Don’t bin old tech. Drop off e-waste where batteries are handled safely and storage is **wiped or destroyed**. We can issue a **Certificate of Data Destruction (CoDD)** on request and we’re local to **Stellenbosch**.

## What counts as e-waste (and what we take)
We accept most **small–medium** electronics common to student homes and SMEs:

- **Computers & parts:** laptops, desktops, mini-PCs, RAM, GPUs, PSUs, motherboards  
- **Storage:** HDDs/SSDs, external drives, USB sticks, memory cards  
- **Mobiles & tablets:** phones, tablets, watches  
- **Networking:** routers, mesh nodes, switches, LTE/5G modems  
- **Peripherals:** monitors, printers/scanners, docks, chargers, cables, mice/keyboards, webcams  
- **Power gear:** UPS units/adapters (remove loose batteries if possible)

Unsure about a **very large** item (copier/server rack/CRT)? Ask first via **[Contact us](/contact/)**.

## Battery safety: how to prepare and transport
Lithium-ion cells are recyclable **but hazardous** if bent or punctured.

**Do this**
- Power down the device; if the pack is swollen, **avoid pressure** on the case.  
- **Tape terminals** and place each cell/device in a **separate clear bag** or small box.  
- Transport **flat**, not in a pocket or tightly packed backpack.  
- Bring directly to us or a qualified drop-off—**never general bins**.

**Don’t do this**
- Don’t pierce, fold or “deflate” swollen packs.  
- Don’t toss Li-ion into refuse/skip bins.  
- Don’t ship damaged batteries without proper declaration/packaging.

## Your data: wipes, destruction & CoDD (POPIA-aware)
Before devices leave controlled storage, we:

1) **Log the device** (serial/asset where available).  
2) Perform a **verified software wipe** (NIST 800-88 r1) or **crypto-erase** when supported by the drive.  
3) If media is unreadable or fails verification, we **physically destroy** it (punch/shred) and document the method.  
4) On request, issue a **Certificate of Data Destruction (CoDD)** for your records.  
5) Handle data under a **POPIA-aligned** process (least-privilege access and secure storage of any artefacts).

Request a certificate → **[Certified Wipe (CoDD)](/services/data-destruction-certified-wipe/)**

## Drop-off and collection options (Stellenbosch)
- **Drop-off:** fastest for laptops, drives, phones and small peripherals.  
- **Collection:** by arrangement for residences/offices and bulk items.  
- **Larger/odd items:** we’ll route you to the right partner recycler.

## Quick prep checklist (before you arrive)
- Sign out of **iCloud/Google/Microsoft** to avoid activation locks.  
- Remove **SIM/microSD** cards if you need them.  
- Include **power supplies** for laptops/routers if available.  
- Label anything that must be returned (e.g., drive caddies).  
- Back up data if the device is still functional.

## Why proper e-waste matters
Electronics combine **valuable** materials (aluminium, copper, gold) and **hazardous** ones (lead, mercury, lithium). Responsible recycling reduces mining, prevents **landfill fires** from damaged batteries, and protects your identity through **secure data handling**.

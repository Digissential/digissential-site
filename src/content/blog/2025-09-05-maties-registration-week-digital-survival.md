> **TL;DR:** New at Stellenbosch University? Set up your **SU email, MFA, Wi-Fi (Eduroam), and printing** in the first week. Digissential can remote-fix issues if you get stuck.

## Why digital setup matters during registration week

With over 32,000 students at SU, your first week is packed. Delays in setting up email, Wi-Fi, or printing can derail coursework before it begins. Common pitfalls:
- Wrong login format for Eduroam.  
- Skipping MFA setup and being locked out of SU portals.  
- Printing queues not configured before assignment deadlines.  
- No backups — leading to lost essays or notes after the first crash.  

## Step-by-step: SU digital essentials

1. **SU Email Setup**  
   Log in with your student number and temporary password. Change it immediately and set recovery options.  

2. **Enable MFA (multi-factor authentication)**  
   SU requires MFA for secure access. Use your phone’s authenticator app or SMS codes.  

3. **Connect to Eduroam Wi-Fi**  
   Use your full SU email (e.g., 12345678@sun.ac.za) + password. Select “Eduroam” from the Wi-Fi list, and trust the campus certificate.  

4. **Printing Setup**  
   Follow campus instructions to install the SU print queue. Always test with a one-page document. Credit is loaded onto your student card.  

5. **Protect & Back Up**  
   Use cloud storage (Google Drive, OneDrive, iCloud) to keep lecture notes safe. Set up automatic sync before you start classes.  

## Common pitfalls to avoid

- Using only your student number instead of full SU email for Eduroam.  
- Ignoring MFA prompts and losing access later.  
- Printing the night before deadlines without testing setup.  
- Relying only on local storage for assignments.  

## What Digissential can remote-fix fast

- **SU email sync issues** on laptops and phones.  
- **Eduroam Wi-Fi profiles** not saving or dropping connections.  
- **Printing queue errors** or driver conflicts.  
- **Cloud backups** misconfigured (OneDrive, Google Drive, iCloud).  
- **Cybersecurity hardening** (antivirus, MFA setup, password hygiene).

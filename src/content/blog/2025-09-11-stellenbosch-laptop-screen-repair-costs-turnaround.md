> **TL;DR:** SU students often crack screens in residence or cafés. Expect **R1,200–R2,200** for most screen repairs in Stellenbosch, with **same/next-day turnaround** if parts are in stock. Digissential adds **CPA-backed warranties** and transparent diagnostics.

## Why screens break so often
- **Residences & cafés:** cramped desks and accidental drops.  
- **Backpacks:** pressure cracks from books or bottles.  
- **Hinges:** weak hinges stress the panel and cause flicker/lines.  

For students and SMEs, a cracked screen is a show-stopper during exams or work deadlines.

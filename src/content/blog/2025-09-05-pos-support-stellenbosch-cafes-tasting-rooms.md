> **TL;DR:** POS hiccups in Stellenbosch cafés and tasting rooms usually come down to Wi-Fi, printers, or card machines. Run the quick checks below — and call Digissential for fast, compliant support.

## Why POS uptime matters in Stellenbosch

In cafés and wine tasting rooms, a single failed card swipe = lost sale. Common issues include:
- Receipt printers suddenly not responding.  
- Card readers dropping during peak hours.  
- Wi-Fi dead zones at POS counters.  
- Printer drivers failing after Windows updates.  

Without stable POS support, service slows and customers leave.

## Quick triage checklist

1. **Restart Wi-Fi/router** — confirm stable coverage at the till.  
2. **Check printer basics** — paper, power, USB/Ethernet plugged in.  
3. **Clear print queue** — reinstall/update drivers if jobs don’t release.  
4. **Test card reader** — switch to mobile data to rule out Wi-Fi.  
5. **Call Digissential** if issues persist — we handle printers, Wi-Fi, and POS configs.

## When remote support works — and when it doesn’t

- **Remote fixes:** driver reinstalls, clearing queues, checking Wi-Fi configs.  
- **On-site required:** faulty cabling, router replacement, persistent printer/card reader issues.  

Digissential offers both, with transparent [Remote Support](/services/remote-support-setup/) and [On-Site Surcharge](/legal/standard-fees/).

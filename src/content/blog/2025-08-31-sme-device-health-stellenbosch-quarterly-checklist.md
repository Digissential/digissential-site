  title: "Quarterly 30-minute device health checklist (safe steps)"
  steps:
    - "Install pending OS updates (Windows/macOS) and vendor tools; reboot once."
    - "Update drivers/firmware where relevant (graphics, storage, BIOS/UEFI) and record versions."
    - "Check disk health (SMART/SSD wear); free space ≥15%; run vendor SSD tool—do not run CHKDSK on failing disks."
    - "Verify backups: last run, size, errors; test-restore one folder to a separate location."
    - "Review passwords & MFA: confirm password manager in use; rotate shared/admin creds; remove leavers."
    - "Note assets: device name, user, serial, warranty date; log changes in your asset sheet."
faq:
  - q: "How long does this take per device?"
    a: "Plan ±30 minutes of touch time per device. Big OS updates may run in the background—schedule after hours to reduce disruption."
  - q: "What tools do I need?"
    a: "Windows Update, vendor driver/firmware tools, CrystalDiskInfo or SSD vendor apps, your backup console (OneDrive/Google Drive/NAS), and a password manager."
  - q: "Can you do this remotely?"
    a: "Yes. Book a [Quarterly Device Health Check](/services/quarterly-device-health-check-remote/) or a [Remote support session](/services/remote-support-setup/)."
  - q: "What if SMART shows warnings or a drive is noisy?"
    a: "Stop heavy use, capture a backup, and replace the drive. We can assist with imaging and swap; do **not** run CHKDSK on failing disks."
  - q: "Do you offer ongoing care plans?"
    a: "Yes—SME Care Plans are rolling out soon. Ask us to enrol your company so we can prioritise updates, backups and compliance."

> **TL;DR:** Spend **30 minutes per device each quarter** and you’ll avoid most outages. Do updates, check SMART/space, verify backups with a **test restore**, tidy passwords/MFA, and log asset notes. We can run this **remotely** for your team.

## What you’ll need (free or built-in)
- **Admin access** to each device.  
- **Windows Update / macOS Software Update**.  
- **Vendor tools**: Dell/HP/Lenovo/ASUS updates; GPU drivers if needed.  
- **Disk health**: CrystalDiskInfo (HDD/SSD) or NVMe vendor utility.  
- **Backup console** (OneDrive/Google Drive/NAS) and **spare space** to test-restore.  
- A **password manager** (Bitwarden, 1Password, etc.) and your **asset sheet**.

## The 30-minute checklist (with ZAR time/cost)

| Step | What you do | Time | Typical cost (ZAR) if we do it remotely |
|---|---|:--:|:--:|
| 1. OS updates | Apply OS/security updates; reboot | 5–8 min | R80–R120 |
| 2. Drivers/Firmware | GPU/storage, BIOS/UEFI if recommended | 4–6 min | R60–R100 |
| 3. Disk health & space | SMART check, SSD wear, free ≥15% | 3–5 min | R50–R80 |
| 4. Backup verify | Check last run; **test-restore** a folder | 5–7 min | R80–R120 |
| 5. Passwords & MFA | Confirm manager use; rotate shared creds | 4–6 min | R60–R100 |
| 6. Asset notes | User, serial, warranty, changes | 2–3 min | R30–R50 |

> **Bundle option:** Book a [Quarterly Device Health Check](/services/quarterly-device-health-check-remote/) for a remote, scripted pass with a summary report and recommendations.

## Step-by-step details (quick and safe)

### 1) Update the OS (then reboot)
- Windows: **Settings → Windows Update → Check for updates**.  
- macOS: **System Settings → General → Software Update**.  
Apply security updates first; feature upgrades can be deferred until after backups are confirmed.

### 2) Drivers & firmware
- Use OEM tools (Dell Command/HP Support Assistant/Lenovo Vantage).  
- Apply **storage, chipset and BIOS/UEFI** updates if recommended; avoid beta firmware on production machines. Record versions in your asset notes.

### 3) Disk health & space
- HDD/SSD: read **SMART** (CrystalDiskInfo or vendor app). If **Caution/Bad**, take a backup and plan a replacement.  
- Keep **≥15% free space**; below that, Windows/macOS slows and updates fail.

### 4) Backups that actually restore
- Check last backup date/size and **zero errors**.  
- Perform a **test restore** of a small folder to a different location—this catches permission or path problems early.  
Need help setting this up? See **[Cloud backup setup](/services/cloud-backup-setup/)**.

### 5) Passwords, MFA & leavers
- Confirm a **password manager** is in use (shared vaults for shared creds).  
- Enforce **MFA** for email/admin portals.  
- Rotate or remove **leaver** accounts the same day.

### 6) Asset notes (don’t skip this)
- Record **device name, user, serial, OS build, warranty date** and any changes.  
- A simple sheet keeps insurance/warranty and replacement planning simple.

## When to escalate (so you don’t lose a day)

- SMART **warnings**, clicking drives, or rising reallocated sectors.  
- Reboots during updates, blue screens, boot loops.  
- Backups that fail repeatedly.  
- Users reporting frequent freezes or network drops.

Book a **[Remote support session](/services/remote-support-setup/)** and we’ll stabilise, document and recommend next steps.

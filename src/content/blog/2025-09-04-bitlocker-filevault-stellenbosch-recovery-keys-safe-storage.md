howTo:
  title: "If you see a BitLocker/FileVault recovery prompt — do this (data-safe order)"
  steps:
    - "Stop repeated reboots. If the disk clicks or SMART shows warnings, power off and book imaging — each boot can worsen damage."
    - "Try another keyboard/layout and enter the code once (look for 8-group or 6-group formatting). Don’t guess repeatedly."
    - "Retrieve the key on a **clean device**: Microsoft account/organisation portal for BitLocker; Apple ID/MDM for FileVault (details below)."
    - "If the key works, boot, make a backup immediately, then investigate why recovery was required (firmware/TPM/secure-boot changes, OS updates)."
    - "If you **can’t** get the key or the drive looks unhealthy, stop DIY. We’ll image first, then attempt unlock/recovery from the image."
faq:
  - q: "Where are BitLocker recovery keys usually stored?"
    a: "Personal PCs → Microsoft account (Devices → Recovery keys). Work/School → your organisation’s directory (device object). Domain PCs → Active Directory. Some users printed or saved a .txt during setup."
  - q: "Where are FileVault keys stored?"
    a: "Personal Macs → iCloud/Apple ID (if you chose that option). Managed Macs → your admin/MDM escrow. Some users set offline recovery keys; check your records."
  - q: "Is it safe to turn off encryption to ‘fix’ this?"
    a: "No. Decrypting a sick disk can push it over the edge. Back up or image first, then change encryption settings."
  - q: "Can you help if I don’t have the key?"
    a: "We can still protect and recover **unencrypted** data regions and attempt OS repair, but without a valid key, encrypted data remains inaccessible by design."
  - q: "What causes sudden key prompts?"
    a: "TPM resets, firmware/BIOS changes, major OS updates, disk/partition changes, or security policy updates. We’ll review recent changes after you’re booted."

> **TL;DR:** Don’t power-cycle endlessly. Fetch the recovery key on a **clean device** (Microsoft/Apple/IT admin), unlock once, **back up immediately**, then fix the root cause. No key and a sick disk? **Stop DIY** — we’ll image first, then attempt recovery.

## What the prompts mean (plain English)

- **BitLocker (Windows):** Your system drive is encrypted. Windows needs the **48-digit recovery key** (8 groups of 6 digits) to unlock.  
- **FileVault (macOS):** Your disk is encrypted with **FileVault 2**. You’ll be asked for your user password or a **recovery key** (alphanumeric blocks).

These screens don’t mean the disk is dead — they’re **asking for proof** you’re allowed in.

## Where to find your key (common places)

### BitLocker
- **Personal Microsoft account:** Sign in on another device → **Devices** → **Recovery keys**.  
- **Work/School (Entra ID/Azure AD):** Ask your IT admin; the key is attached to the **device object**.  
- **On-prem AD:** IT can read the key from **Active Directory** (if escrow was enabled).  
- **Printed/USB/.txt:** Check the places you save important docs.  
- Already in Windows and want to note it for later?  
  - Run: `manage-bde -protectors -get C:` and save the **Recovery Key** ID & value.

### FileVault
- **Apple ID (if chosen at setup):** Sign in on another device → check the Mac’s **FileVault recovery** option.  
- **MDM/IT:** Managed Macs escrow the key with your admin.  
- **Local recovery key:** Some users wrote it down; look for a 24-character code in 6 groups.  
- Already in macOS and want to note it for later?  
  - Run: `fdesetup status` (should say *FileVault is On*), then `sudo fdesetup recover` or check your MDM profile for escrow.

## Do-nots (they make things worse)

- **Don’t** factory-reset or reinstall **over** the encrypted disk before backup.  
- **Don’t** run disk “repairs” or **CHKDSK** on a clicking/SMART-failing drive.  
- **Don’t** guess the key repeatedly (lockouts happen).  
- **Don’t** disable BitLocker/FileVault during instability; **back up first**.

## Our recovery workflow (data-first)

1) **Intake & quick health checks** — power, SMART/SSD wear, temperatures.  
2) **Image first** if any instability is detected (we preserve a read-only copy).  
3) **Unlock/repair from the image** using your provided key; verify sample files.  
4) **Fix the root cause** — firmware/TPM alignment, OS/driver repair, bootloader, or policy changes.  
5) **Handover & hardening** — confirm backups, store keys safely, document what changed.

## A simple, safe key-storage plan (students & SMEs)

**Students (1–3 devices)**
- Store the recovery key in your **password manager** (secure note), plus one printed copy in a safe place.  
- Keep **OneDrive/Google Drive** active so you can back up right after an unlock.  
- Add **recovery codes** for email/Microsoft/Apple IDs to the same secure note.

**SMEs (5–50 devices)**
- **Centralise**: escrow BitLocker keys to your **organisation directory**; escrow FileVault keys to **MDM**.  
- **Document**: device → user → key escrow location → last verified date.  
- **Break-glass**: keep a sealed admin account + vault procedure for after-hours incidents.  
- **Quarterly**: test one device unlock path end-to-end; rotate anyone who has access to keys.

## FAQs

**Windows: the screen shows a Recovery Key ID — what do I do with it?**  
Give us (or your admin) that **Key ID**; it matches the right key in your directory/portal. Then we unlock once, back up, and fix the cause.

**Mac: I forgot the FileVault password and don’t have the key. Can you still help?**  
We can stabilise the Mac and protect hardware, but encrypted data needs the correct key/password. If you find it later, we can continue recovery.

**Why did BitLocker ask for a key after a BIOS update?**  
The **TPM/secure-boot** trust changed; BitLocker wants confirmation. Enter the key, then we’ll re-seal BitLocker to the new configuration.

**Should I keep encryption on?**  
Yes. It protects your data if a laptop is lost/stolen. Just make sure **keys are escrowed** and backups exist.

**Will imaging void encryption?**  
No. We image sectors safely; when a valid key exists we work from the image to rebuild files, reducing risk to your original disk.

---

**Bottom line:** Encryption is your friend — **if** keys are stored sensibly. When a prompt appears, unlock **once**, **back up**, and fix what caused it. If you can’t get the key or the disk sounds unhappy, we’ll protect your data and take it from there.

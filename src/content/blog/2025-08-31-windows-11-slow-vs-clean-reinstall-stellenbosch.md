howTo:
  title: "Quick checks before choosing tune-up or clean reinstall"
  steps:
    - "Check storage health: open SMART info (e.g., vendor tool). If ‘Caution/Bad’ or reallocated sectors are rising, plan drive replacement and OS reinstall."
    - "Look at free space: keep at least 15% free. If under 10%, clear bulky files or move to an external drive/cloud."
    - "Inspect startup impact: Task Manager → Startup apps. Disable toolbars/launchers you don’t use."
    - "Scan for malware/PUPs: run a reputable scanner. If infections keep returning, a clean reinstall is faster and safer."
    - "Note symptoms: freezes, 100% disk, Windows Update failures, BSODs. Persistent OS errors or failed upgrades point to reinstall."
faq:
  - q: "How long does each option take?"
    a: "Tune-up: ±1–2 hours of bench/remote time, often same-day. Clean reinstall with backup: ±2–4 hours depending on data size, usually same/next-day."
  - q: "Will I lose my data on a clean reinstall?"
    a: "No—our standard process backs up your profile and key folders first, then restores after reinstall. We confirm what you need saved."
  - q: "Can this be done remotely?"
    a: "Tune-ups and malware removal can be remote if the laptop boots and has internet. Reinstalls are best in-shop for speed and reliability."
  - q: "What if SMART is failing?"
    a: "Stop heavy use, back up immediately, and replace the drive. We can clone/imaging and reinstall Windows on the new SSD."
  - q: "How often should I reinstall?"
    a: "There’s no fixed schedule. If startup bloat, malware, or repeated update errors persist after a tune-up, a reinstall is the quicker long-term fix."

> **TL;DR:** Start with health checks (SMART, RAM, startup, malware). If hardware is fine and Windows updates run cleanly, a **tune-up** usually restores speed **same-day**. If there’s persistent corruption, recurring malware, or a failing/old HDD, a **clean reinstall** (with backup) saves time and avoids repeat visits.

## What we check first (and why it matters)

- **Storage health (SMART/SSD wear).** If the disk’s unhealthy or still a spinning HDD, a **reinstall to SSD** is the winning move.  
- **Free space (≥15% free).** Low space = constant disk thrash and failed updates.  
- **Startup & services.** Toolbars, launchers and bloat slow boot.  
- **Malware/PUPs.** Repeat infections waste time—nuke from orbit with a reinstall if they keep returning.  
- **Windows Update / component store.** CBS errors and failed Feature Updates often indicate deeper OS issues.

## Decision tree (plain-English version)

1) **SMART warning or HDD present?**  
→ Replace/upgrade drive and **clean reinstall** Windows. You’ll feel the difference immediately.

2) **Updates failing / DISM/SFC keep finding errors?**  
→ **Clean reinstall**. Deep OS rot is faster to fix fresh.

3) **Malware found repeatedly or browser hijacks return?**  
→ **Clean reinstall** (after a quick data backup). Otherwise you’ll chase symptoms.

4) **Hardware healthy, updates clean, just bloated startups?**  
→ **Tune-up**: remove PUPs, trim startups, update drivers/firmware, clear temp caches.

5) **Unclear? Under exam or deadline pressure?**  
→ Start with a **tune-up**. If errors persist, pivot to reinstall the same day.

## What’s in a professional **tune-up**

- Targeted **malware/PUP removal** and browser reset  
- **Startup & services** trim; scheduled tasks review  
- **Driver and Windows Update** pass; optional BIOS/firmware where recommended  
- Disk cleanup (temporary files), privacy/sensor sanity, performance power plan  
- Short **health report** with next-step recommendations

## What’s in a **clean reinstall** (with backup)

- **Pre-backup** of your user profile (Desktop/Documents/Pictures, browser profile, “known folders”)  
- Fresh Windows 11 install, drivers, updates, device enrollment if needed  
- Reinstall your listed apps (as provided) and restore data to a tidy structure  
- Optional **SSD upgrade** during the same visit for maximum speed  
- Post-setup checklist: BitLocker/Microsoft account, OneDrive/Desktop redirection, default browser, printers

## Time & ZAR cost ranges (realistic for Stellenbosch)

| Scenario | Our recommendation | Typical time | Typical ZAR range* |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| Healthy SSD, just bloated | Tune-up | 1–2 hrs | R650–R1 200 |
| Recurring malware/PUPs | Tune-up → Reinstall if it returns | 1–3 hrs | R650–R1 600 |
| HDD present / SMART warnings | Reinstall + SSD upgrade | 2–4 hrs | R1 100–R2 800 (excl. SSD) |
| Update failures / corrupted OS | Clean reinstall with backup | 2–4 hrs | R950–R1 600 |

\* Final quote depends on model, data size and any extra parts/software you request. We’ll confirm at check-in.

## Safe at-home checks (if you’re curious)

- **Task Manager → Startup.** Disable obvious junk (toolbars, updaters).  
- **Storage settings.** Clear temp files; aim for **≥15% free**.  
- **Windows Security → Virus & threat protection.** Run a scan once.  
- **Command prompt (admin):** `sfc /scannow` then `DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth` (don’t loop this if errors keep returning—fresh install is faster).

If you’d rather not tinker, we can do all of this for you **same/next-day**.

## FAQs

**Can you keep my files and apps on a reinstall?**  
We back up your files and restore them. Apps are reinstalled cleanly (you may need license keys for some).

**How do I avoid getting slow again?**  
Use a password manager (no toolbars), keep drivers/Windows updated, and uninstall trialware. We can set a **quarterly tune-up** if you like.

**Will a reinstall fix hardware problems?**  
No—bad RAM, failing SSD/HDD, or thermal issues need hardware attention. We’ll flag anything we find during diagnostics.

**Can you do this today?**  
Often yes. Tune-ups are same-day; reinstalls are same/next-day depending on data size. Ask for priority if you’re mid-exam.

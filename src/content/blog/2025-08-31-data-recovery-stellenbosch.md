  title: "Safe steps before professional data recovery"
  steps:
    - "Stop using the device immediately. Do not install apps or copy files to the same drive you’re trying to recover."
    - "Check the basics once: different USB port/cable/power supply, and try another machine. Avoid repeated power cycling."
    - "Open **Disk Management** (Windows) to see if the disk is detected. **Do not** initialise, format, or run CHKDSK."
    - "If files are readable, copy a few key folders **to a different disk** and stop at the first error."
    - "If the drive clicks, disappears, asks to format, or copy speeds collapse—**bring it in** for recovery and request CoDD after your data is safe."
faq:
  - q: "Can I use free recovery software?"
    a: "Only if the disk is healthy and fully detected. On failing disks, repeated scans can worsen damage. We image the drive first, then recover from the image."
  - q: "What if the hard drive is not detected?"
    a: "Stop power cycles. Non-detected drives often need hardware-level work or controlled imaging. Bring it in for assessment."
  - q: "How long does data recovery take?"
    a: "Simple logical recoveries can be same/next day. Unstable or mechanically degraded drives can take 2–5 working days depending on imaging speed and parts availability."
  - q: "Do you follow POPIA and sign NDAs?"
    a: "Yes. We align with POPIA, restrict access to authorised technicians, and can sign an NDA. After successful recovery, we can perform a Certified Wipe (CoDD) of your old media."

> **TL;DR**: If your drive is clicking, asking to “format”, or copies keep failing—**stop using it**. Try one safe check (different port/cable/PC), **don’t run CHKDSK or endless recovery scans**, and bring it in for professional imaging. After recovery, put a backup plan in place and request a **Certificate of Data Destruction (CoDD)** for the old media.

## What you’ll learn
- The **big do-nots** that kill recoverable data.
- **Safe first checks** you can do at home or in the office.
- Exactly **when to bring it in** for professional imaging.
- What happens after recovery (backup + CoDD), and how we handle **POPIA**.

## The big **do-nots** (they quietly make things worse)

1. **Don’t keep power-cycling** a sick drive. Each spin-up can add wear or worsen head/media damage. Two tries is enough—then stop.  
2. **Don’t run CHKDSK / “repair” tools** on a failing disk. They modify the filesystem and can turn a recoverable directory tree into orphaned fragments.  
3. **Don’t install recovery software on the same disk** you’re trying to rescue. Install on a **different** drive or use a clean PC.  
4. **Don’t open the drive** (no kitchens, no “dust-free” shoebox miracles). A cleanroom isn’t optional for internal work.  
5. **Don’t write backups to the same disk** “just for now.” You need a **destination drive** with enough free space.  
6. **Don’t freeze a drive**. That old myth risks condensation and head slap—modern drives don’t like it.  
7. **Stop copying if errors start**. Every stutter can be an indicator the heads are struggling. Get imaging done first.

## Quick, safe checks (that won’t dig the hole deeper)

- **Cables & ports:** try another USB cable/port; for 3.5″ desktop externals, confirm the power brick.  
- **Second computer:** if it shows up there, your first machine might be the problem.  
- **Windows Disk Management:** if the disk appears as *Unknown/Not initialised*, don’t initialise it. If it shows a drive letter, try copying a few small folders to another disk—**stop on the first error**.  
- **SMART status:** some tools can read SMART (e.g., CrystalDiskInfo). If “Caution/Bad”, avoid heavy scans and seek imaging.  
- **Laptops & spills:** if the machine was dropped or liquid-damaged, **don’t try repeated boots**. Remove power and get it assessed.

If you can see files and copy them cleanly to another disk—great. If you hit errors, hear clicks, or the drive disappears, jump to **professional imaging**.

## When to bring it in (and what we actually do)

Bring it in if any of these apply:

- **Clicking, grinding, or beeping** sounds.  
- **“You need to format the disk before you can use it”** prompts.  
- **Drive not detected** or keeps disconnecting.  
- **Copy speed collapses** to near-zero or Windows freezes on file access.  
- **After a drop, spill, or surge**.

**Our process:**  
1) **Intake & assessment.** We check power, adapters, interface and run non-intrusive diagnostics.  
2) **Imaging first.** We clone as much readable data as possible to a stable image, avoiding re-reads that heat/kill heads.  
3) **Logical recovery.** We rebuild the filesystem from the image and verify sample files with you.  
4) **Handover.** Data is delivered on your destination drive (or we can supply one).  
5) **Post-recovery options.**  
   - Set up a **backup plan** so this doesn’t happen again.  
   - Perform a **Certified Wipe (CoDD)** of the old media and issue a certificate.  
   - Provide a short **POPIA** summary of how your data was handled.

## Special notes by storage type

### External USB hard drives (2.5″/3.5″)
- Use the **original enclosure** and known-good cable. If the drive spins up and drops off, the **USB-SATA bridge** may be failing. Imaging is still the safest route.

### Internal laptop drives
- If Windows asks to repair or you see endless “automatic repair” loops, **stop** and get an image first. Laptop airflow and student backpacks are a rough combo—don’t cook a borderline disk with hours of retries.

### SSDs
- SSDs fail differently. They can vanish without noise and reappear intermittently. Avoid deep scans and **never secure-erase** before recovery (it’s irreversible).

### “Hard drive not detected”
- Try a different port/cable and one other PC. If still invisible on **Disk Management**, it’s time for a bench assessment—repeated tries won’t help.

## After recovery: lock in a backup (so this is the last time)

- **3-2-1 rule**: 3 copies of your data, on 2 different media, with 1 off-site (cloud).  
- **Students:** an affordable external SSD + OneDrive/Google Drive sync covers most needs.  
- **SMEs:** NAS with cloud replication; document the process and test restores quarterly.  
- **Sensitive data:** once files are handed over and confirmed, request **Certified Wipe (CoDD)** for the old media to satisfy compliance.

## FAQs

**Can you recover files from a drive that Windows wants to format?**  
Often, yes. Don’t format it. Bring it in so we can image first and recover the filesystem from the image.

**I tried software but it got stuck—did I ruin my chances?**  
Not necessarily. Stop the scan and power down. The sooner we image a struggling disk, the better the odds.

**How much does data recovery cost in Stellenbosch?**  
Logical recoveries are usually in the lower range; unstable or mechanically degraded drives cost more due to imaging time and parts. We’ll confirm a quote after assessment.

**Will you keep my files?**  
We retain recovery images only as long as needed for verification/hand-over, then securely wipe them. Ask if you’d like a **CoDD** for device disposal or reuse.

**Can you collect?**  
Collection/drop-off is available in Stellenbosch by arrangement. Mention it on [/contact/](/contact/).

## Final word

When a drive starts misbehaving, time and attempts matter. **Stop, check once, and preserve the disk**—then let imaging do the heavy lifting. We’ll recover what’s possible, help you put a backup in place, and, if needed, issue a **Certificate of Data Destruction** so you can move on with confidence.

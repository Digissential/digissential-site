howTo:
  title: "5 checks to decide: cleanup, SSD upgrade or clean reinstall"
  steps:
    - "Storage health & space: Check SMART/SSD wear (vendor tool) and free space. If health is Caution/Bad or free space <15%, prioritise an SSD upgrade or clean-up."
    - "RAM pressure: In Activity Monitor → Memory, if ‘Memory Pressure’ is yellow/red with everyday apps, close heavy tabs/apps; older 8 GB Macs may feel slow regardless—SSD helps most."
    - "Startup & agents: Remove unused login items/launch agents; browser → remove dodgy extensions. If junk returns, a clean reinstall is faster."
    - "Updates: Apply macOS updates and recommended firmware; if updates repeatedly fail or system files keep corrupting, reinstall cleanly."
    - "Battery & thermals (laptops): High cycle count, throttling heat or a swollen pack will feel like ‘slow’—service battery first, then re-test."
faq:
  - q: "What fixes a slow Mac fastest?"
    a: "If you still have a hard drive or failing SSD, an **SSD upgrade** is the biggest win. If storage is fine but the OS is messy, a **clean reinstall** with migration is cleaner than chasing ghosts. Otherwise a **targeted cleanup** is enough."
  - q: "How long will it take?"
    a: "Cleanup/tune-up: ±1–2 hrs, often same-day. SSD upgrade + clone: ±2–4 hrs (stock-dependent). Clean reinstall with migration: ±2–4 hrs depending on data size."
  - q: "Will I lose data?"
    a: "No—our SSD upgrades and reinstalls include a backup/clone first. We confirm what matters (Desktop/Documents/Photos, mail, browser)."
  - q: "When is Apple-authorised repair better?"
    a: "Active AppleCare+, keyboard/top-case programmes, or Touch ID/T2/Face ID pairing needs. We’ll say so up-front and help you with referral."
  - q: "Can you do this remotely?"
    a: "Cleanup and app hygiene can be remote if the Mac boots and is online. Reinstalls and SSD swaps are in-shop for speed and safety."

> **TL;DR:** Check **storage health/space**, **memory pressure**, **startup junk** and **updates**. If the disk is weak or still a HDD, do an **SSD upgrade**. If corruption/malware keeps coming back, do a **clean reinstall** with migration. Otherwise, a focused **cleanup** is enough—see realistic ZAR ranges below.

## What we see most in Stellenbosch (and what actually helps)

| Scenario | Symptom snapshot | Our recommendation | Typical time | Typical ZAR* |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|
| Still on a HDD or failing SSD | 100% disk, beachballs, slow app opens | **SSD upgrade + clone** | 2–4 hrs | R1 400–R3 200 (+SSD) |
| Healthy SSD, just bloated | Slow boot, lots of menubar apps, pop-ups | **Speed-up & tune-up** | 1–2 hrs | R650–R1 200 |
| Recurring errors/malware | Updates fail, OS glitches return | **Clean reinstall + migration** | 2–4 hrs | R950–R1 600 |
| Heavy multitasking on 8 GB | Tabs + Teams/Zoom choke | **Tune-up** (trim + settings) → consider newer Mac later | 1–2 hrs | R650–R1 200 |

\* Final quote depends on model, data size and parts availability. We confirm at check-in.

**Book the right thing fast:**  
- Cleanup → **[Speed-up & tune-up](/services/speedup-tuneup/)**  
- Big speed win → **[SSD upgrade & clone](/services/ssd-upgrade-bundle-clone-swap/)**  
- Fresh start (with backup & migration) → We’ll guide **clean reinstall** in-shop; start via **[Remote support session](/services/remote-support-setup/)**  
- Move files/app settings → **[Data migration (device-to-device)](/services/data-migration-device-to-device/)**

## Parts availability & model notes

- **Upgradable models (best value):** Many 2012–2015 MacBook Pro/Air and older iMacs accept SATA/NVMe SSDs—huge speed jump.  
- **T2/Apple silicon models:** Storage is soldered; no post-purchase upgrade. Focus on **clean reinstall** + good storage hygiene.  
- **Batteries:** Worn or swollen packs mimic ‘slowness’ (throttle). Replace safely before performance testing.  
- **Authorised vs third-party:** If an Apple service programme applies (e.g., keyboard/top-case), **authorised** wins on price/warranty—we’ll advise.

## What each option includes

### Speed-up & tune-up
- Remove PUPs/toolbars, reset browsers, trim startup/agents  
- Apply macOS updates, verify firmware where recommended  
- Clear caches/temp files; set sensible privacy & power settings  
- Short **health report** with next steps

→ **[Book tune-up](/services/speedup-tuneup/)**

### SSD upgrade & clone
- Health check → clone your data to a new SSD  
- Fit SSD, update firmware where needed, verify boot  
- Post-clone cleanup & app updates

→ **[Upgrade SSD](/services/ssd-upgrade-bundle-clone-swap/)**

### Clean reinstall (with migration)
- Pre-backup of user data, fresh macOS install  
- Migrate user profile/apps, restore settings  
- Post-setup checks (iCloud, Mail, printers, browsers)

→ Start via **[Remote support session](/services/remote-support-setup/)** (we’ll schedule the in-shop reinstall)

---

## Quick at-home checks (safe)

- **Storage:**  menu → About This Mac → More Info → Storage (keep **≥15%** free).  
- **Memory pressure:** Launchpad → Activity Monitor → Memory (green = fine).  
- **Login items:** System Settings → General → Login Items (remove clutter).  
- **Browser:** Remove shady extensions; clear site data for heavy users.  
- **Back up now:** Time Machine or cloud before any big changes.

---

## When to escalate (so you don’t waste time)

- SMART “Caution/Bad”, clicking or vanishing drives  
- macOS update loops/failures  
- Malware/adware that keeps returning  
- Swollen battery, thermal shutdowns, or liquid damage

We’ll stabilise quickly and give you a clear ETA.

## FAQs

**Can you keep my Photos and Mail during a reinstall?**  
Yes—those are part of the migration. We verify sample files with you before handover.

**Do I need antivirus on a Mac?**  
Built-in protections help, but adware/PUPs are common. The bigger wins: browser hygiene, updates, and no shady installers.

**Will an SSD upgrade help an old iMac?**  
Massively. A SATA SSD (or NVMe in supported models) is the single best upgrade for older iMacs.

**What about battery health on MacBooks?**  
High cycle counts and swollen packs hurt performance and safety. We’ll test and quote a safe replacement if needed.

**Can you do this same/next-day?**  
Often yes for tune-ups; SSD upgrades are same/next-day if the SSD is in stock; reinstalls depend on data size.

faq:
  - q: "Do you use genuine Apple parts?"
    a: "We propose **OEM or high-grade compatible** parts depending on model, budget and availability. Where Apple-authorised repair is clearly the better route, we’ll tell you and help with referral."
  - q: "Will I lose data?"
    a: "Battery/keyboard work doesn’t touch storage, but **always back up first**. We can help with cloud or external backups before service."
  - q: "How long do repairs take?"
    a: "Battery swaps and many SSD upgrades are **same/next-day** if in stock. Top-case keyboards and special batteries are typically **2–4 working days** depending on parts."
  - q: "What about swollen batteries?"
    a: "Power down and **do not press** on the case. Bring it in promptly. We’ll fit a safe replacement and route the old pack via lawful e-waste streams."
  - q: "Is AppleCare+ required?"
    a: "No. If you have an active AppleCare+ plan, some issues may be cheaper/faster with an Apple-authorised provider. We’ll advise which path makes best sense."

> **TL;DR:** Most MacBook issues in Stellenbosch fall into **battery wear**, **keyboard faults/top-case assemblies**, and **slow or full storage**. Expect **same/next-day** on common batteries and SSD upgrades (if in stock), and **2–4 working days** for top-case keyboards or special-order parts. We’ll also tell you when **Apple-authorised** repair is the better value.

## What you’ll learn (fast)
- Typical **ZAR price bands** and **turnarounds** for MacBook batteries, keyboards and SSD upgrades.  
- How model year & design (butterfly vs scissor, T2/Apple silicon) affect cost/time.  
- When we recommend **authorised Apple repair** vs best-value third-party.  
- How to prep: backups, chargers, and what to expect at check-in.

## Common fixes, real-world ranges (Stellenbosch)

> Final quotes depend on exact model (A-number/year), part grade and supplier stock. We confirm everything after diagnostics.

| Fault / Service | Typical ZAR | Turnaround | Notes |
|---|---:|:--:|---|
| **Battery replacement** | 1 600–3 500 | Same/next-day if in stock; 2–4 days if ordering | Some models use adhesive battery packs; we handle safe removal & e-waste. → [Battery replacement](/services/battery-replacement-labour/) |
| **Keyboard / top-case** | 2 200–6 000 | 2–4 days | Butterfly-era models often require full **top-case** assemblies (keyboard + battery). We’ll advise when authorised Apple service is better value. → [Keyboard replacement](/services/keyboard-replacement-labour/) |
| **SSD upgrade & clone** | 1 400–3 200 (+ SSD) | Same/next-day | Older SATA/NVMe-upgradable models benefit most; Apple silicon models use onboard storage (no upgrade). → [SSD upgrade & clone](/services/ssd-upgrade-bundle-clone-swap/) |
| **Trackpad / speakers / fans** | 900–2 500 | Same/next-day to 2–4 days | Availability varies by model; we’ll quote after parts check. |
| **Liquid damage clean & assess** | Quote after intake | 1–2 days | Time-sensitive—power down, don’t charge. We clean, test, and prioritise data-first imaging if needed. |
| **OS reinstall & tune-up** | 950–1 600 | Same/next-day | Clean macOS reinstall, updates, drivers and migration for speed & stability. |

## Parts availability & model nuances (what affects price/time)

- **Batteries:** Unibody/Retina packs are glued; top-case batteries (e.g., some 2016–2019 models) pair with keyboards. We source **OEM or high-grade compatible** cells with supplier warranty (typically **3–12 months**).  
- **Keyboards:** “Butterfly”-era MacBooks (2016–2019) often require **entire top-case** replacement. If you still have Apple’s service program eligibility, **authorised** repair may be cheaper—ask us to check.  
- **Storage:**  
  - **2012–2015**: many can accept SATA/NVMe upgrades (big speed win).  
  - **T2/Apple silicon**: storage is on the board—**no post-purchase upgrade**; we’ll focus on clean installs and capacity management.  
- **Genuine vs compatible:** We’ll be transparent: if an Apple-authorised route is clearly the better outcome (warranty/recall pricing), we’ll recommend it and help you move quickly.

## How we work (and how to prep)

1) **Intake/diagnostic** — confirm model (A-number/serial), battery cycle count, keyboard condition, SSD health and thermals.  
2) **Quote & ETA** — parts grade (OEM/compatible), warranty, and turnaround. No surprises.  
3) **Repair/test** — anti-static handling, torque-correct reassembly, charge/discharge tests, keyboard/trackpad verification.  
4) **Handover** — advice for longevity (charging habits, ventilation), and lawful **e-waste** routing for old parts.

**Before you come in**  
- **Back up** (Time Machine or cloud). Need help? → [Cloud backup setup](/services/cloud-backup-setup/)  
- Bring the **charger** (helps power/battery diagnostics).  
- Note any **liquid spills** or previous repairs.

---

## When we recommend Apple-authorised repair
- **Active AppleCare+** or known **service programs** (e.g., butterfly keyboard campaigns).  
- **Board-level** failures on recent models still within extended warranty windows.  
- **Face ID/Touch ID/T2 pairing** concerns where Apple calibration is required.

We’ll tell you upfront if that route is best **for price, warranty or turnaround**, and we’ll help you prepare (backup, intake notes) so you don’t lose time.

## FAQs

**Will a new battery improve performance?**  
It improves reliability and run-time. Some models throttle when batteries are failing; a healthy pack avoids surprise shutdowns.

**My keys double-type—can you fix just the keycaps?**  
Sometimes, but butterfly-era faults usually need a **top-case**. We’ll test and tell you whether compatible or authorised Apple service is the better call.

**Can you upgrade the SSD on my MacBook Air/Pro?**  
Many **2012–2015** models yes; **Apple silicon** and most T2-era models are **not** upgradable. We’ll check your exact model and quote options.

**What warranty do you offer?**  
Parts carry the supplier’s warranty (typically **3–12 months**). Our workmanship is guaranteed. Old batteries and damaged parts are routed via **e-waste** streams.

**Do you collect in Stellenbosch?**  
Pickup/drop-off is available **by arrangement**, subject to workload. Mention it on **[Contact us](/contact/)**.

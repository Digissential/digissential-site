## Typical costs in Stellenbosch (student-friendly ranges)

> Final quotes depend on your exact model, part grade and supplier stock. We’ll confirm after a quick diagnostic.

| Fault / Service | Typical ZAR | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| **Screen replacement** | 1 600–4 500+ | Standard 14–15.6″ non-touch panels are often 1 600–2 800; touch/high-res/OLED and some Apple panels cost more. See [Laptop screen replacement](/services/laptop-screen-replacement-labour/). |
| **Battery replacement** | 900–2 200 | OEM vs high-grade compatible affects price; some ultrabooks/Macs use top-case assemblies. See [Battery replacement](/services/battery-replacement-labour/). |
| **Windows reinstall (with backup)** | 950–1 600 | Clean reinstall, drivers, updates and restore of your profile. See [Windows reinstall with backup](/services/windows-reinstall-with-backup/). |
| **Malware cleanup / tune-up** | 650–1 200 | Same-day if it boots; can be remote. See [Remote support session](/services/remote-support-setup/). |
| **SSD upgrade + data move** | 1 100–2 800 | Includes the drive and cloning where healthy; data recovery quoted separately. |
| **Board-level / liquid damage** | Quote after assessment | Needs diagnostic first; success depends on severity and time since spill. |

## Turnarounds you can plan around

- **Same-day (often):** diagnostics, tune-ups/malware cleanup, RAM/SSD swaps (if parts on hand), Windows reinstall with backup.  
- **Next-day:** many batteries and standard non-touch screens **if in stock**; hinge screws/keyboard swaps on common models.  
- **2–4 working days:** special-order panels/batteries and certain ultrabook top-cases; liquid-damage cleaning + observation.  
- **Longer:** rare models, board-level repair, or when supplier stock is constrained.

## Remote help vs drop-off (what’s fastest today)

**Remote support (when it boots):**  
Great for **slow Windows**, pop-ups, driver tangles, printer issues and quick tune-ups—no travel time.  
→ Book: **[Remote support session](/services/remote-support-setup/)**

**Drop-off (most hardware jobs):**  
Screens, batteries, keyboards and thermal work are best done at the bench with anti-static handling.

**Pickup / drop-off (by arrangement):**  
Available near campus/town—handy when your day is packed. Ask on **[Contact us](/contact/)**.

## Why we start with a diagnostic

A structured diagnostic prevents wrong parts and repeat visits:

1. **Health check:** power, storage SMART, memory, thermals, battery wear.  
2. **Fault isolation:** e.g., panel vs cable vs GPU for display problems.  
3. **Quote + ETA:** part grade, warranty and options, before any spend.  
4. **Approval + fix:** same/next-day where stock allows.

## Study-week tips to avoid repeat issues

- **Don’t bag-squeeze the lid**—it’s how hairline panel cracks happen.  
- **Keep ventilation clear** during long calls; heat throttling feels like “slow Windows.”  
- **Use OneDrive/Google Drive** so notes sync while we work on the device.  
- **Bring the charger** with the laptop; it speeds battery/power diagnosis.

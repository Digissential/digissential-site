howTo:
  title: "Quick checks: is it the panel, cable or GPU?"
  steps:
    - "Plug in an external display (HDMI/USB-C/DisplayPort). If external works but the laptop screen is black/garbled, your GPU is likely fine—suspect panel/cable."
    - "Flashlight test: shine a light at an angle. If you faintly see the desktop, the **backlight** or panel power path has failed—usually a panel swap."
    - "Lid-angle test: if image cuts out or flickers when you change the lid angle, the **display cable/hinge area** is suspect."
    - "Lines/ink blotches from a knock = cracked LCD (panel swap). Uniform ‘no image’ on both internal & external = deeper board/BIOS/SSD issue."
    - "If the screen is usable, **back up key folders** before repair (cloud or external drive) and book diagnostics."
faq:
  - q: "How much does a screen replacement cost in Stellenbosch?"
    a: "Most 14–15.6″ non-touch panels land around **R1 600–R2 800**; high-res, touch, OLED and many Apple panels cost more (often **R3 000–R4 500+**). We confirm after diagnostics."
  - q: "How long does it take?"
    a: "**Next-day** if the exact panel is in stock; **2–4 working days** if we need to order. Cable-only faults can be same/next-day when parts are available."
  - q: "Could it be the cable instead?"
    a: "Yes—especially if the image drops when moving the lid. Cables/hinge looms are cheaper than panels but are model-specific."
  - q: "Will I lose my data?"
    a: "Display work doesn’t touch storage, but we recommend a quick backup first. We can help you set up a cloud/external backup before service."
  - q: "Do you collect near campus/Technopark?"
    a: "Pickup/drop-off can be arranged in Stellenbosch **subject to availability**. Mention it on Contact."

> **TL;DR:** External monitor works? GPU’s probably fine. **Faint image with a torch** → backlight/panel; **flickers with lid movement** → cable; **lines/ink blotches** → cracked panel. Expect **next-day** if in stock, or **2–4 working days** to order. Realistic ZAR ranges below.

## Real ZAR ranges (typical in Stellenbosch)

> Final quotes depend on model, panel spec and supplier stock. We confirm after diagnostics.

| Fault / Service | Typical ZAR | Turnaround | Notes |
|---|---:|:--:|---|
| **Laptop screen replacement** | 1 600–4 500+ | Next-day if in stock; 2–4 days to order | Non-touch standard panels are lower; touch/high-res/OLED and Apple panels cost more. → [Laptop screen replacement](/services/laptop-screen-replacement-labour/) |
| **Display cable / hinge loom** | 600–1 400 | Same/next-day to 2–4 days (parts) | Symptoms change with **lid angle**; some models integrate cable with hinges. |
| **GPU/board-level video fault** | Quote after assessment | Case-dependent | Rare vs panel/cable; if both internal **and external** displays fail, we’ll assess board, RAM and storage first. |
| **OS reinstall (if software-corruption)** | 950–1 600 | Same/next-day | For cases where external works but Windows login/driver issues blank the screen. |

## Simple decision tree (plain-English)

1) **External screen OK, internal dead/garbled?**  
   → **Panel or cable.** Run flashlight + lid-angle tests to split them.

2) **Faint desktop visible with a torch?**  
   → **Backlight/panel** failure → **panel swap**.

3) **Image drops when you move the lid?**  
   → **Cable/hinge loom** issue → replace the cable (and inspect hinges).

4) **Both internal & external are black/garbled?**  
   → Suspect **GPU/board**, RAM or storage corruption → diagnostics first.

5) **Impact crack / coloured lines / ink blotches?**  
   → **Cracked LCD** → **panel swap** (order exact spec).

## Turnarounds you can plan around

- **Same-day / next-day:** diagnostics, cable swaps (when parts on hand), standard non-touch screens if stocked.  
- **2–4 working days:** special panels/batteries and certain ultrabook assemblies.  
- **Longer:** board-level faults or rare panels.

We’re close to **Eikestad Mall** and support **Technopark**—tell us your schedule and we’ll prioritise realistically.

## Prep before you visit (saves time)

- **Back up** your Desktop/Documents/Pictures (cloud or external). Need help? → [Cloud backup setup](/services/cloud-backup-setup/)  
- **Bring the charger** (helps power/backlight tests).  
- **Describe the symptom** (when it started, any drops/spills, whether lid angle changes it).  
- **Avoid lid pressure** when travelling—squeezed lids cause hairline cracks.

## Book the right thing (fast)

- [Laptop screen replacement](/services/laptop-screen-replacement-labour/)  
- [Cloud backup setup](/services/cloud-backup-setup/)  
- [Contact us](/contact/)

## Extra tips (so it doesn’t happen again)

- Use a **padded sleeve**; don’t pack tight against textbooks.  
- Don’t pick up the laptop by the **screen corner**.  
- Keep vents clear; heat + pressure shortens panel life and cable flex.

## Final word
Most “black screen” cases are **panel or cable**, not the GPU. Do the quick checks above, back up if you can, and book a diagnostic. We’ll give you an honest quote and a realistic ETA—and keep you working while parts arrive.

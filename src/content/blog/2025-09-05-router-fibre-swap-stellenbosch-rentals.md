  title: "Checklist for router/ISP swaps in Stellenbosch rentals"
  steps:
    - "Label your current router (SSID, Wi-Fi password) before swapping hardware."
    - "Decide whether to re-use the same SSID/password or set up a new one."
    - "Check ISP instructions: DHCP (auto) vs bridge/PPPoE settings."
    - "Reconnect laptops and test speed before adding smart-home devices."
    - "Re-join 2.4 GHz smart devices manually if they don’t auto-connect."
    - "If devices still won’t connect, book Digissential for on-site or remote Wi-Fi setup."

    a: "Yes — if you want smart-home devices to reconnect automatically. But a new SSID/password may improve security."
  - q: "Do I need special settings for fibre in Stellenbosch?"
    a: "Most ISPs use DHCP (auto), but some require PPPoE logins. Check your ISP’s guide or let Digissential configure it."

> **TL;DR:** When swapping routers or fibre ISPs in Stellenbosch, re-use your SSID/password, check ISP settings, and reconnect 2.4 GHz smart devices. If problems persist, Digissential gets you back online fast.

## Why router & fibre swaps cause headaches

In Stellenbosch rentals, fibre lines often change hands when tenants move or ISPs switch. Common issues:
- Laptops refuse to connect after a router swap.  
- Smart bulbs, cameras, and printers won’t rejoin the network.  
- New router defaults to a different SSID and password.  
- ISPs use different settings (DHCP vs PPPoE), breaking connectivity.  

Without prep, downtime can last hours.

## Checklist before & after swapping routers

1. **Label your current network**  
   Write down your SSID (Wi-Fi name) and password.  

2. **Re-use or update credentials**  
   - Re-use old SSID/password = most smart devices reconnect automatically.  
   - New SSID/password = more secure but means rejoining every device manually.  

3. **Confirm ISP settings**  
   - Stellenbosch ISPs mostly use DHCP.  
   - Some require PPPoE logins — check your contract or ask support.  

4. **Test laptops & phones first**  
   Run a speed test to confirm fibre is active.  

5. **Re-join smart-home devices**  
   Many IoT devices only connect to **2.4 GHz**. Make sure your router broadcasts both 2.4 and 5 GHz.  

6. **Call in help if needed**  
   If devices still won’t connect, Digissential offers on-site and remote troubleshooting.

## Do-nots

- Don’t reset your router to factory defaults unless you have ISP credentials handy.  
- Don’t assume all smart devices support 5 GHz. Many only work on 2.4 GHz.  
- Don’t share your new Wi-Fi password over insecure channels (WhatsApp groups, etc.).

## When to call Digissential

- ISP confirms fibre is active but your router won’t connect.  
- Smart-home devices won’t rejoin even after re-using old SSID/password.  
- You need a mesh Wi-Fi setup for bigger student digs or SME offices.

  title: "Safe quick checks for home Wi-Fi"
  steps:
    - "Move the router higher with clear line of sight; keep it away from metal, mirrors, microwaves and fish tanks."
    - "Use 5 GHz for speed nearby; keep 2.4 GHz for older devices or long range."
    - "Set 2.4 GHz channel to 1, 6 or 11 (20 MHz width). On 5 GHz use 36–48 or 149–165 (80 MHz width)."
    - "Rename SSIDs clearly (e.g., MyFlat-2G / MyFlat-5G) and set a strong WPA2/3 password; disable WPS."
    - "If Zoom still drops, test with Ethernet or a USB-C LAN adapter. If that fixes it, plan mesh or placement changes."

faq:
  - q: "Why does my Wi-Fi get worse at night?"
    a: "Shared apartments and residences add interference, especially on 2.4 GHz. Use 5 GHz where possible, set 2.4 GHz to channel 1/6/11 (20 MHz), and avoid overlapping channels."
  - q: "Should I use 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz?"
    a: "5 GHz is faster with less interference but shorter range. 2.4 GHz reaches further and through walls. Use 5 GHz for laptops/phones near the router; 2.4 GHz for IoT or distant rooms."
  - q: "My laptop says ‘connected, no internet’—is it my ISP?"
    a: "Maybe. First test with an Ethernet cable or phone hotspot. If Ethernet works but Wi-Fi drops, it’s a local wireless issue (placement/channel). If both fail, log a fault with your ISP."
  - q: "Can you help remotely?"
    a: "Yes. We can tune channels, widths and SSIDs over a remote session and guide placement. Book at [/services/remote-support-setup/](/services/remote-support-setup/)."
  - q: "Do you install mesh systems?"
    a: "Yes. We plan node placement, backhaul options and SSID strategy for small flats to multi-room homes. See [/services/mesh-wifi-planning-install/](/services/mesh-wifi-planning-install/)."

> **TL;DR:** Most residence Wi-Fi issues are **placement + band + channel width**. Put the router high with line of sight, use **5 GHz** for speed, **2.4 GHz (20 MHz)** for reach, and pick clean channels. If Zoom still stutters, test Ethernet; if that’s solid, book a **remote tune-up** or plan a **mesh**.

## What you’ll learn
- The three levers that fix most problems: **placement**, **band selection**, and **channels/width**.
- A quick way to tell if the fault is **Wi-Fi vs ISP**.
- Student-friendly tweaks for **Zoom/Teams** classes and calls.
- When to book a **remote tune-up** or install **mesh Wi-Fi**.

## 1) Placement: free performance you can see

Radio hates obstacles. The more walls, metal and mirrors between you and the router, the worse the signal.

- **Height & sight.** Place the router **waist-to-head height** on a shelf or wall, not on the floor or inside a cupboard.  
- **Spread antennas.** If your router has external antennas, set two at ~45–60° and one vertical—helps both horizontal and vertical coverage.  
- **Avoid interference.** Keep **1–2 m** away from microwaves, cordless bases, large metal fridges, mirrors, and fish tanks.  
- **One SSID per flat (ideally).** Too many networks with similar names confuse devices. If you manage multiple APs, use the **same SSID and password** across them with non-overlapping channels.

If moving the router cuts disconnects in half, you’ve found the biggest win already.

## 2) Bands & channel width: pick the right lane

### 2.4 GHz (range)
- Best for **through-walls reach** and legacy devices.  
- Use **channel 1, 6 or 11** only.  
- Set **channel width to 20 MHz**. Wider widths overlap neighbours and cause retries.

### 5 GHz (speed)
- Faster and less crowded; range is shorter.  
- Use channels **36–48** or **149–165**.  
- Set **80 MHz** width near the router; drop to **40 MHz** if the airwaves are busy or your router struggles.

Pro tip: **Separate SSIDs** (e.g., `MyFlat-2G` and `MyFlat-5G`) so you can choose the best band per device. Some routers “band-steer” well; others don’t.

## 3) Zoom/Teams stability checklist

- **Prefer 5 GHz** for calls; sit closer to the router.  
- **Ethernet beats Wi-Fi.** A cheap **USB-C/USB-A Ethernet adapter** can save an exam or interview.  
- **Close bandwidth hogs:** cloud sync, Steam updates, torrents.  
- **Use headphones** to reduce echo; enable **noise suppression** in app settings.  
- **Test upstream.** Upload needs to be stable for video—if your speedtest has jitter or spikes, call your ISP or move to Ethernet for the session.

---

## 4) Router basics that actually help

- **Reboot ≠ fix**. Reboot once after changes; constant power-cycling hides real faults.  
- **Update firmware** from the admin page or manufacturer app.  
- **Rename SSIDs** clearly and **disable WPS**; use **WPA2-PSK/WPA3-SAE**.  
- **Use a strong passphrase** (12+ chars); avoid flat number or name.  
- **Record your settings** (screenshot). After a reset, you can re-apply them in minutes.

## 5) Is it Wi-Fi or the ISP?

1. **Test Ethernet.** Plug your laptop into the router with a cable.  
   - If **Ethernet is fast and stable** but Wi-Fi lags → it’s a **wireless** problem (placement/channel/width).  
   - If **Ethernet also drops**, log a fault with your **ISP** (line noise, congestion, or router fault).  
2. **Try a phone hotspot** briefly. If the call is perfect on LTE/5G, your apartment Wi-Fi or ISP link is the culprit.  
3. **Check router lights/logs** for DSL/Fibre drops or re-syncs.

We can help you **collect evidence** and escalate to the ISP if needed.

## 6) When to install mesh (and how to do it right)

- **Use mesh** if you need coverage in multiple rooms or floors.  
- Place nodes **one wall apart** from each other—good signal between nodes is critical.  
- Prefer **wired backhaul** (Ethernet or powerline if clean); otherwise, keep nodes in **line of sight** for a strong wireless backhaul.  
- Keep **one SSID** across nodes for seamless roaming; avoid double NAT by bridging your ISP router where possible.

## 7) Quick outcomes we can deliver remotely

- Read the local **Wi-Fi spectrum**, choose cleaner channels, and set widths.  
- Rename SSIDs and improve security (WPA2/3, no WPS).  
- Optimise **Zoom/Teams** device settings.  
- Document a **backup Ethernet plan** for exams/interviews.

## Privacy & your data

We follow **POPIA-aligned** practices when we access your network during remote sessions. Only authorised technicians view settings, and any credentials you share are handled securely.

## Final word

Most Stellenbosch Wi-Fi issues don’t need a new ISP—just the **right band, clean channels and better placement**. Try the safe checks above; if calls still stutter, book a **remote tune-up** or plan **mesh** for reliable coverage.

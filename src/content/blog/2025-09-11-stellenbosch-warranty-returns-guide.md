  title: "Checklist before booking a warranty repair in Stellenbosch"
  steps:
    - "Check your invoice: note the repair date and parts fitted."

    - "Recreate the fault clearly: video or notes help us verify faster."
    - "Bring in accessories (charger, cable, screen hinge) if related to the fault."
    - "Complete a Job Intake so we can log it against your warranty record."

> **TL;DR:** In Stellenbosch, the **Consumer Protection Act (CPA)** plus Digissential’s own warranties mean you’re covered: 90-day labour guarantee, parts under supplier terms, and transparent returns.

## Why warranties matter in local repairs
- **Trust:** students and SMEs want to know repairs last.  
- **Compliance:** the CPA enforces minimum rights on parts and workmanship.  
- **Transparency:** published warranty rules avoid awkward disputes.

## Digissential’s warranty promise
- **Labour:** 90-day warranty on all repair work.  
- **Parts:** covered by the supplier/manufacturer (usually 6–12 months).  
- **Process:** documented in [Annex C – Warranty & Returns](/legal/warranty-returns/).  

If something fails, we log the case, test it, and repair/replace under the correct warranty stream.

## CPA rights in plain English
- If a part fails during its warranty, you can claim **repair, replacement, or refund**.  
- Repairs must be “fit for purpose” — meaning your laptop/PC should work as expected.  
- Accidental damage (drops/liquid) isn’t covered; that’s outside warranty scope.

## When to call Digissential

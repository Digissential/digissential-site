  title: "Quick checks if your external monitor isn’t detected"
  steps:
    - "Check cable type: some USB-C ports support charging only, not video."
    - "Test with a known-good HDMI/USB-C cable."
    - "Power cycle both laptop and monitor before retrying connection."
    - "Open display settings (Windows/Mac) and detect external display manually."
    - "Update GPU/display drivers; if still failing, book professional diagnostics."
faq:
  - q: "Why isn’t my USB-C to HDMI adapter working?"
    a: "Not all USB-C ports carry video. Look for a DP (DisplayPort) or Thunderbolt logo next to the port. Try another adapter or cable."
  - q: "Can drivers cause detection issues?"
    a: "Yes. Outdated GPU or display drivers often stop external monitors from being detected. Updating them usually resolves it."
  - q: "What if my monitor works on another laptop?"
    a: "That points to an issue with your laptop’s port, drivers, or GPU. Hardware diagnostics may be required."
  - q: "How much does troubleshooting cost in Stellenbosch?"
    a: "Diagnostics are R150. Driver install is R180. Component replacement (if needed) starts at R400 labour, plus parts."

> **TL;DR:** If your external monitor isn’t detected in Stellenbosch, check cable/port compatibility, update GPU drivers, and test display settings. Digissential resolves both software and hardware issues quickly.

## Why monitors fail to connect

Coworking and home offices in Stellenbosch often struggle with:
- USB-C ports that only charge, not output video.  
- HDMI cables/adapters failing silently.  
- Outdated drivers after Windows/macOS updates.  
- Laptops throttling or overheating, causing GPU detection failures.  

These problems often hit just before presentations or deadlines.

## Quick triage checklist

1. **Check the port** — look for a **DP/Thunderbolt symbol** near the USB-C port. Charging-only ports won’t output video.  
2. **Test the cable/adapter** — try another known-good HDMI or USB-C cable.  
3. **Restart devices** — power down both monitor and laptop, then reconnect.  
4. **Detect display manually** —  
   - Windows: Settings → System → Display → Detect.  
   - macOS: Apple Menu → System Settings → Displays → Detect Displays.  
5. **Update GPU drivers** — outdated drivers cause most detection errors.  

If none of these work, it’s likely hardware (port, GPU, or mainboard).

## When to stop DIY

- If your monitor works fine on another laptop.  
- If your USB-C port feels loose or damaged.  
- If GPU drivers are up to date but detection still fails.  
- If the laptop overheats or crashes with an external screen.  

These point to deeper hardware faults — time for pro diagnostics.

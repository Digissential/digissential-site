  title: "What to do when you’ve lost data"
  steps:
    - "Stop using the device — further writes can overwrite deleted files."
    - "Note the symptoms (clicking drive, no power, accidental delete)."
    - "Book a **Data Recovery (Simple / Logical)** attempt first."
    - "If the drive is clicking or burnt, prepare for a specialist lab referral."
    - "Once files are safe, set up a **Data Backup (Basic)** to prevent repeat loss."
faq:
  - q: "Can you recover deleted files in Stellenbosch?"
    a: "Yes — if the drive still works and hasn’t overwritten the data. Logical recovery often brings files back."
  - q: "What if my drive is clicking?"
    a: "Stop using it immediately. That’s physical damage — we’ll refer to a partner lab with cleanroom facilities."
  - q: "Do you recover from spills or fire damage?"
    a: "Minor spills may be recoverable. Severe burns or warped platters usually require lab work with no guaranteed success."
  - q: "How much does recovery cost?"
    a: "Logical recovery starts around R950. Specialist lab jobs can run several thousand rand depending on damage."
  - q: "How do you protect my privacy?"
    a: "We follow our POPIA Notice, require consent via waiver, and issue Certificates of Data Destruction when drives are wiped after recovery."

> **TL;DR:** Data loss hits Stellenbosch students (theses) and SMEs (invoices). Digissential handles **logical recoveries in-shop**, while **physical damage** goes to labs. Expect transparent costs, CPA rights, and POPIA-safe handling.

## Real stories we see in Stellenbosch
- **Student laptop crash:** hard drive stops booting before exam submission. Logical recovery saves thesis files.  
- **SME invoice database:** deleted by mistake. We recover from the drive image and set up backups.  
- **Water-damaged MacBook:** partial recovery possible, but severe board corrosion limits results.  
- **Clicking external HDD:** too risky to run in-house; referred to lab with cleanroom.

## What we can recover in-shop
- Accidentally deleted files.  
- Drives that still spin and mount intermittently.  
- Logical corruption (file system errors).  
- Phone/USB data in some cases.  

Service: [Data Recovery (Simple / Logical)](/services/data-recovery-simple-logical/)

## What usually needs a lab
- Clicking or grinding drives (mechanical failure).  
- Fire or flood damage.  
- Severely encrypted ransomware cases.  

We partner with certified labs, explain costs upfront, and only proceed with client consent.

## Preventing future heartbreak
- [Data Backup (Basic)](/services/data-backup-recovery/) to protect coursework and invoices.  
- [Data Migration](/services/data-migration/) when moving to new laptops or storage.  
- Optional CoDD after failed drives are securely wiped for compliance.

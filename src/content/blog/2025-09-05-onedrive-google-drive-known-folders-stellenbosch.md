> **TL;DR:** Use OneDrive/Google Drive Known Folders in Stellenbosch to auto-backup Desktop, Documents, and Pictures. It’s exam-safe for students and POPIA-smart for SMEs.

## Why auto-backups matter

- **Students:** losing a thesis draft the night before submission = disaster.  
- **SMEs:** invoices, quotes, and tax records must be safe for compliance.  
- **Everyone:** accidental deletes or ransomware can be rolled back with versioning.  

Manual backups are unreliable. Known Folders make backups automatic.

## How Known Folders work

- **OneDrive**: “Known Folder Move” backs up Desktop, Documents, and Pictures to the cloud.  
- **Google Drive**: “My Computer folders” lets you sync chosen folders to Drive.  

Both ensure every saved file is automatically protected — no drag-and-drop required.

## Best practices for Stellenbosch setups

1. **Enable Desktop/Documents/Pictures sync** during setup.  
2. **Set upload bandwidth caps** (e.g., 2–5 Mbps) so fibre/Wi-Fi remains usable in student digs and SME offices.  
3. **Test restore**: pick an old file, restore a previous version, confirm it works.  
4. **Use MFA (multi-factor authentication)** on cloud accounts for POPIA compliance.  
5. **Verify cross-device sync** before exams or client deadlines.

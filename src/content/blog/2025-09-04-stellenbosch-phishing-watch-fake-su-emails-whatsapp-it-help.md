howTo:
  title: "Clicked a fake SU mail/WhatsApp? Clean up in this order (data-safe)"
  steps:
    - "Isolate first: if you clicked a file/link, disconnect Wi-Fi/Ethernet. Don’t shut down during disk noises/clicks—protect evidence and data."
    - "Change passwords on a clean device: start with email/IDP (Microsoft/Google), then banking and socials. Never from the possibly infected machine."
    - "Reset MFA: remove old authenticators, re-enrol MFA, and regenerate recovery codes. Check for new “app passwords” or unknown devices and revoke sessions."
    - "Scan & clean: on the affected machine, run a reputable AV/EDR scan; remove dodgy extensions and startup items. If scans keep finding things, stop and book malware cleanup."
    - "Secure the mailbox: delete malicious rules/forwarders, check “Send As/Delegates”, and verify no auto-forward to outside addresses."
    - "Back up and patch: make a quick backup of documents to trusted storage; apply OS/browser updates before reconnecting to the network."

faq:
  - q: "What do fake SU emails and WhatsApps look like?"
    a: "Urgent tone, password/MFA code requests, shortened links, mismatched domains (e.g., not @sun.ac.za) and attachments (ZIP/DOCM). SU IT will not ask for your password over email/WhatsApp."
  - q: "I entered my password—what now?"
    a: "Immediately change the password from a clean device, reset MFA, revoke sessions and check mailbox rules/forwarders. Then run a malware check on the original machine."
  - q: "Do you help students and SMEs?"
    a: "Yes. We can clean systems, harden accounts, and set safer defaults (MFA, filter rules) via remote or in-shop visits."
  - q: "Is this POPIA-related?"
    a: "Yes. Email often contains personal information. Under POPIA you must secure access, limit exposure and keep audit notes. We follow least-privilege, and can sign an NDA."
  - q: "Can you recover files if malware encrypted them?"
    a: "Sometimes. We triage, try safe recovery paths and restore from backups if available. If the disk is failing, we image first to protect data."

> **TL;DR:** Red flags: **urgent SU notices**, **odd domains**, requests for **password/MFA codes**, or **attachments**. If you clicked, **isolate**, change passwords/MFA on a **clean device**, remove malicious mailbox rules, then clean the PC. We can help remotely, fast.

## Spot the fakes (Stellenbosch examples)

**Email tells**  
- From name ≠ address (e.g., “IT Help” <random@gmail.com>), or look-alike domains (`sun-support.co` instead of **sun.ac.za**).  
- Links go to URL shorteners or mismatched domains (hover to preview).  
- Threats of immediate account closure, exam lockout, or bursary loss.  
- Attachments that demand macros: `.zip`, `.rar`, `.docm`, `.xlsm`.

**WhatsApp “IT help” tells**  
- Unsolicited offers to “verify your SU account” or “fix MFA” if you send a code.  
- Profile photos using SU branding but non-official numbers.  
- Payment requests for “remote cleanup” via voucher/instant EFT.

When unsure, forward the message (as an **attachment/screenshot**) to your trusted admin or ask us to review.

## If you clicked or opened a file (what to do now)

1. **Disconnect** network (Wi-Fi off, pull Ethernet).  
2. On a **clean device**, change your **email/IDP** password first, then banking/socials.  
3. **Re-enrol MFA** and regenerate **recovery codes**; remove unknown devices/sessions.  
4. On the affected machine, run a malware scan; if it keeps flagging items or performance tanks, **stop DIY**.  
5. **Mailbox sweep:** delete suspicious rules (auto-forward, move-to-Archive), clear malicious delegates, and confirm “Reply-To” isn’t altered.  
6. **Inform** teammates/housemates if their addresses were scraped; advise them to ignore similar messages you didn’t send.  
7. **Back up** key files and apply updates before reconnecting.

## Harden in under 30 minutes (low-effort wins)

- **MFA everywhere** (especially email/admin). Store **recovery codes** safely.  
- **Disable legacy auth** (POP/IMAP/SMTP AUTH) where possible.  
- **Filtering:** enable “External” banners; quarantine spoofed domains.  
- **Password manager:** unique credentials; share via vaults, not WhatsApp.  
- **Browser hygiene:** remove shady extensions; update browsers automatically.  
- **Backups:** set a **3-2-1** plan so you can restore cleanly after incidents.

We can set a baseline via **[Cybersecurity hardening](/services/cybersecurity-hardening/)** and confirm mailbox/domain controls later.

## Residence/office quick tips

- **Shared PCs:** add **standard** (non-admin) accounts for day-to-day use.  
- **Wi-Fi:** prefer 5 GHz near the router; don’t share your WPA key in group chats.  
- **Printers/routers:** change default passwords; disable **WPS**.

## Final word

Phishing works because it’s **fast and emotional**. Slow it down: check the sender domain, don’t share MFA codes, and clean up in the **right order** if you slip. We’ll help you contain, clean, and prevent repeat incidents—**POPIA-aware** from start to finish.

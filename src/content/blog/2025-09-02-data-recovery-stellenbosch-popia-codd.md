  title: "Safe steps before professional data recovery"
  steps:
    - "Stop using the device. Do not install apps or copy files to the same drive you’re trying to recover."
    - "Check basics once: different USB port/cable/power supply, and try another PC. Avoid repeated power cycling."
    - "In Windows, open Disk Management to see if the disk appears. Do not initialise, format, or run CHKDSK."
    - "If files open, copy a few key folders to a different disk and stop at the first error."
    - "If the drive clicks, disappears, or asks to format—bring it in for imaging and request CoDD after recovery."

faq:
  - q: "Can I use free recovery software?"
    a: "Only on a healthy disk that’s fully detected. On unstable drives, repeated scans can worsen damage. We image first, then recover from the image."
  - q: "What if the hard drive is not detected?"
    a: "Stop power cycles. Non-detected drives often need hardware-level work or controlled imaging. Bring it in for assessment."
  - q: "How long does data recovery take?"
    a: "Logical recoveries can be same/next day. Unstable or mechanically degraded disks may take 2–5 working days depending on imaging speed and parts."
  - q: "Are you POPIA-aware and will you sign an NDA?"
    a: "Yes. We align with POPIA, restrict access to authorised technicians, and can sign an NDA. After recovery, we can issue a Certificate of Data Destruction (CoDD) on request."
  - q: "Do you collect in Stellenbosch?"
    a: "Pickup/drop-off can be arranged, subject to availability. Mention it on Contact."

> **TL;DR:** If your drive is clicking, prompts to “format”, or keeps dropping off—**stop using it**. Try one safe check (different cable/port/PC), **don’t run CHKDSK or endless scans**, and bring it in for **imaging-first** recovery. We’re **POPIA-aware** and can issue a **Certified Wipe (CoDD)** after your files are safe.

## What you’ll learn
- The **big do-nots** that quietly kill recoverable data.  
- **Safe first checks** you can do without making things worse.  
- When to **bring it in** for professional imaging.  
- How we handle your data under **POPIA**, plus **CoDD** after recovery.

## The big **do-nots** (they make things worse)

1. **Don’t keep power-cycling** a sick drive. Two tries is enough—then stop.  
2. **Don’t run CHKDSK/“repair” tools** on a failing disk. They write changes and can destroy directory structure.  
3. **Don’t install recovery software on the same drive** you’re rescuing. Use a clean machine or different disk.  
4. **Don’t open the drive** outside a clean environment.  
5. **Don’t back up to the same drive** “just for now.” You need a separate destination disk.  
6. **Don’t freeze a drive**—that myth risks condensation and head slap.  
7. **Stop at the first error** during copies; pushy retries heat the disk and accelerate failure.

## Quick, safe checks (without digging the hole deeper)

- **Cables & ports:** try another USB cable/port; for 3.5″ externals, confirm the power brick.  
- **Second computer:** if it works there, your first machine may be the issue.  
- **Disk Management (Windows):** if shown as *Unknown/Not initialised*, **do not** initialise it. If it has a drive letter, copy a few small folders to another disk and stop at the first error.  
- **SMART status:** if “Caution/Bad”, avoid deep scans and seek imaging.  
- **Drops/spills:** if the device was dropped or liquid-damaged, avoid repeated boots—get an image first.

If files copy cleanly to another disk—great. If errors or noises appear, move to **professional imaging**.

## When to bring it in (and what we actually do)

Bring it in if any apply:

- **Clicking, grinding, or beeping** sounds  
- **“Format disk to use”** prompts  
- **Not detected** or keeps disconnecting  
- **Copy speeds collapse** to near-zero or lockups on open  
- After **drop/spill/surge**

**Our process:**  
1) **Intake & assessment** → non-intrusive checks for power/interface faults.  
2) **Imaging first** → clone as much readable data as possible to a stable image, minimising head re-reads.  
3) **Logical recovery** → rebuild the filesystem from the image; verify sample files with you.  
4) **Handover** → data delivered on your destination drive (we can supply one if needed).  
5) **Post-recovery options** → set up a **backup plan** and perform a **Certified Wipe (CoDD)** of old media.

## Special notes by storage type

### External USB hard drives (2.5″/3.5″)
Use the **original enclosure** and a known-good cable. If the drive spins up and drops off, the **USB–SATA bridge** may be failing; imaging is still the safest path.

### Internal laptop drives
If Windows loops “automatic repair” or shows 100% disk usage, **stop** and get an image first—don’t bake the disk with hours of retries.

### SSDs
SSDs can **vanish** intermittently with no noises. Avoid deep scans; never secure-erase before recovery (it’s irreversible).

### “Hard drive not detected”
Try one other port/cable and a second PC; if still invisible, it’s bench time. Repeated tries won’t help.

## After recovery: lock in a backup & handle old media

- **3-2-1 rule:** 3 copies, 2 different media, 1 off-site (cloud).  
- **Students:** an external SSD + OneDrive/Google Drive sync fits most budgets.  
- **SMEs:** NAS + cloud replication; test restores quarterly.  
- **POPIA:** after handover, request **CoDD** to certify media sanitisation/destruction.

## FAQs

**Can you recover a drive Windows wants to format?**  
Often, yes. Don’t format; we’ll image first and recover the filesystem from the image.

**I tried software and it got stuck—did I ruin it?**  
Not necessarily. Stop the scan and power down. The sooner we image, the better the odds.

**How much does recovery cost in Stellenbosch?**  
Logical cases sit at the lower end; unstable or mechanically degraded disks cost more due to imaging time/parts. We confirm a quote after assessment.

**Will you keep my files?**  
We retain recovery images only as long as needed for verification/handover, then securely wipe them. Ask for a **CoDD** if you’re disposing of the device.

**Do you collect?**  
Collection/drop-off is available in Stellenbosch by arrangement—mention it on **[Contact us](/contact/)**.

  steps:
    - "Check compatibility: does your laptop/PC support SATA, NVMe, or both?"
    - "Select the right SSD size: 500GB is the sweet spot for students/SMEs."
    - "Use trusted cloning software to copy your old drive to the new SSD."
    - "Test the SSD in an external enclosure before swapping."
    - "Swap drives, boot, and confirm all data/files are intact."
faq:
  - q: "What’s the difference between SATA and NVMe SSDs?"
    a: "SATA SSDs are cheaper but capped around 550 MB/s. NVMe SSDs use PCIe lanes, reaching 2000–5000 MB/s on modern systems."
  - q: "Do all laptops support NVMe?"
    a: "No. Many older laptops only support 2.5” SATA drives. Check your slot type before buying."
  - q: "How much faster is an SSD vs HDD?"
    a: "Even SATA SSDs feel 5–10× faster for boot and load times. NVMe adds another 3–5× boost for heavy tasks."
  - q: "Can I clone my old drive to a new SSD?"
    a: "Yes. Cloning keeps your OS, apps, and files intact. Digissential offers safe clone & swap services."
  - q: "What if cloning fails?"
    a: "We can reinstall the OS, restore from backup, or recover data separately before swapping."

> **TL;DR:** An SSD upgrade is the fastest way to revive laptops and PCs in Stellenbosch. Check SATA vs NVMe support, pick the right size, and follow a safe clone → swap plan.

## Why SSD upgrades matter

In Stellenbosch student digs and SME offices, older laptops and desktops often slow down due to HDDs. SSDs offer:
- 5–10× faster boots.  
- Quicker app loads and multitasking.  
- Longer laptop battery life.  
- Lower heat and noise.

## SATA vs NVMe: what you need to know

- **SATA SSDs**  
  - Use 2.5” form factor or M.2 SATA slot.  
  - Speeds: ~550 MB/s.  
  - Best for older laptops and budget upgrades.  

- **NVMe SSDs**  
  - Use M.2 PCIe slot (look for “NVMe” label).  
  - Speeds: 2000–5000 MB/s depending on PCIe gen.  
  - Best for newer laptops, gaming rigs, and SMEs needing speed.  

**Tip:** Check your laptop/desktop’s slot before buying. Not all M.2 slots support NVMe.

## Capacity sweet spots (2025 pricing in Stellenbosch)

- **500GB:** Ideal balance for students (OS + apps + files).  
- **1TB:** SMEs needing space for projects/invoices.  
- **2TB+:** High-capacity gaming or media rigs.

## Safe clone → swap workflow

1. **Check compatibility** — SATA vs NVMe slot.  
2. **Choose SSD size** — 500GB+ for students/SMEs.  
3. **Clone old drive** using trusted software.  
4. **Test in enclosure** before swapping.  
5. **Install SSD** and boot to confirm data integrity.

## Pitfalls to avoid

- Cloning bad sectors from a failing HDD → clone errors.  
- Forgetting to update BIOS/UEFI for NVMe recognition.  
- Overheating on NVMe drives without heatsinks in small laptops.  
- Accidentally wiping the wrong drive during clone.

## Realistic costs in Stellenbosch (ZAR)

- **Diagnostics (slot check):** R150.  
- **Clone & Swap service:** R450.  
- **OS Reinstall + backup restore:** R650.  
- **SSD hardware:** 500GB from R900, 1TB from R1,500 (market dependent).

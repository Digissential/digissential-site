  title: "Best-practice migration (data-safe and fast)"
  steps:
    - "Back up both Macs first (Time Machine or a full image). Verify you can open a few files from the backup."
    - "Update both Macs to the latest macOS they support. On the new Mac, complete the initial setup to the desktop."
    - "Use **Migration Assistant** over **wired** USB-C/Thunderbolt or a good Ethernet link; avoid weak Wi-Fi. Migrate **Users + Apps + Settings**."
    - "After migration, install **Apple silicon (Universal)** versions of apps. Enable **Rosetta 2** when prompted for Intel-only tools."
    - "Sign back into iCloud/Google/Microsoft, verify Mail and Photos, and re-authorise Adobe/Microsoft/DAW plug-ins as needed."
faq:
  - q: "Should I do a clean install or use Migration Assistant?"
    a: "If your Intel Mac is healthy, Migration Assistant is fastest. If it’s messy or malware-prone, clean-install on the new Mac and migrate only your user data."
  - q: "Will my Intel apps run on Apple silicon?"
    a: "Most do via **Rosetta 2**. Prefer native Apple-silicon installers for performance. Pro tools (plugins, drivers) may need vendor updates."
  - q: "How long does it take?"
    a: "Anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours—depends on cable speed and data size. Wired beats Wi-Fi every time."
  - q: "What about Photos and Mail?"
    a: "If you use iCloud, they’ll re-sync. For on-device libraries, Migration Assistant brings them across; let Photos reindex before heavy use."
  - q: "My old Mac is failing—can you still move data?"
    a: "Often yes. We take a **disk image first**, then migrate from the image to protect your files."

> **TL;DR:** Back up **both** Macs, update them, and run **Migration Assistant** over a **wired** link. Install **Apple-silicon** app versions (enable **Rosetta** for Intel-only tools), then sign back into your services and verify Photos/Mail. If the old Mac is unstable, we image it first.

## Before you start (save headaches)

- **Backup x2:** Time Machine or a **full-system image** of the Intel Mac, plus a quick copy of Desktop/Documents/Pictures to an external drive.  
- **Power + cable:** Keep both Macs **on power**. Use **USB-C/Thunderbolt** or Ethernet (USB-C dongles are fine).  
- **Updates:** Update macOS on both; vendor utilities/firmware on the Intel Mac can reduce transfer errors.  
- **Licences:** Deauthorise iTunes/Music (if you’re at the device limit) and sign out of any apps that strictly count activations.

## Two reliable paths (choose one)

### A) Straight Migration Assistant (fastest)
1. On both Macs: Applications → Utilities → **Migration Assistant**.  
2. On the **new** Mac, choose **From a Mac, Time Machine backup, or startup disk** → Continue.  
3. On the **old** Mac, choose **To another Mac** → select the new Mac.  
4. Select **Users, Applications, Settings** (and “Other files” if needed).  
5. Let it finish. First boot may be busy (indexing). Give Photos/Spotlight time.

### B) Clean install → user-data only (cleanest)
1. Finish new-Mac setup to a temporary admin.  
2. Run Migration Assistant and **only** migrate your **user account(s)** and **Documents**.  
3. Manually install fresh Apple-silicon app versions; sign in and restore settings.

> Unsure which path? If the Intel Mac is cluttered or unstable, pick **B**. Otherwise, **A** is great.

## App & driver notes (Apple silicon realities)

- **Rosetta 2** lets Intel apps run—approve it the first time you open an Intel-only app.  
- Prefer **Universal/Apple silicon** installers for: browsers, Adobe CC, Office, IDEs, media tools, VPNs.  
- **Kernel extensions/drivers** (e.g., legacy NTFS, audio interfaces) may need vendor updates. Check each vendor’s Apple-silicon page after migration.  
- Re-enable **login items** thoughtfully—skip old updaters you don’t need.

---

## Mail, Photos & iCloud sanity

- If you used **iCloud** on the Intel Mac, sign in on the new Mac and let it re-sync; expect indexing for **Photos** and **Mail**.  
- **On-device Photos library**: Migration Assistant brings it; open Photos once and leave it to finish background tasks.  
- **Outlook**/other mail: add accounts fresh if you didn’t migrate apps; let them fully re-index before judging performance.

---

## Common pitfalls we handle

- Stalls over weak Wi-Fi → switch to **USB-C/Thunderbolt** or Ethernet.  
- App activations hit limits → de-authorise/reactivate properly.  
- Old NTFS/T2 issues → we image first and restore safely.  
- FileVault/Activation Lock surprises → we verify unlocks and **re-escrow** keys for you.

## Final checks (5-minute post-migration)

- ✅ Sign in: Apple ID, Microsoft/Google, Adobe  
- ✅ Install native Apple-silicon versions; enable **Rosetta** when needed  
- ✅ Photos/Mail finished indexing  
- ✅ Printers/Scanners re-added; test a page/scan  
- ✅ Time Machine turned on (new target)  
- ✅ Recovery keys stored safely (FileVault on)

## FAQs

**Can I migrate from a Time Machine backup instead of the old Mac?**  
Yes—often faster and less fussy. Connect the backup drive to the new Mac and choose **From a Time Machine backup** in Migration Assistant.

**Will my Boot Camp partition move?**  
No—Boot Camp x86 doesn’t run on Apple silicon. Use a VM for Windows-on-ARM if needed.

**Do I need antivirus on macOS?**  
Built-in protections are strong, but browser hygiene and signed installers matter most. We can add light AV if your risk profile needs it.

**What if the old Mac won’t boot?**  
Don’t keep power-cycling. We’ll **image** the drive and migrate from the image to protect your data.

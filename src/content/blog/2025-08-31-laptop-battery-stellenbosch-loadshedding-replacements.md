howTo:
  title: "Quick battery-health checks (safe to do at home)"
  steps:
    - "Check wear level: Windows → Win+X > PowerShell → run `powercfg /batteryreport`; on macOS → Option-click the battery icon or System Settings > Battery and review ‘Maximum Capacity’."
    - "Look for swelling: gaps at the trackpad/keys, case not sitting flat, creaking when you press the palm rest. **Power down and stop charging** if you suspect swelling."
    - "Runtime sanity check: from 100%, do light browsing on battery; if it drops >20% in 15 minutes, capacity is likely degraded."
    - "Back up important folders to an external drive or cloud so the swap is smooth."
    - "Book a replacement and request safe disposal of the old pack with a certificate if required."
faq:
  - q: "How long does a battery replacement take?"
    a: "Many mainstream models are same/next-day if we have stock. Ultrabooks/Mac top-case assemblies take longer (parts dependent). We’ll confirm at check-in."
  - q: "Do you use genuine or compatible batteries?"
    a: "We source **OEM or high-grade compatible** packs depending on availability and your budget. We’ll advise cycle life expectations and provide supplier warranty."
  - q: "My battery looks swollen—can I still use the laptop?"
    a: "No. Power down, unplug and avoid pressure on the case. Bring it in promptly. Swollen lithium-ion cells can damage the trackpad/keyboard and pose a fire risk."
  - q: "Will I lose data during the swap?"
    a: "Battery swaps don’t touch your storage, but **back up first** as a best practice. If you need help, book a cloud or external backup setup."
  - q: "Can you dispose of the old battery legally?"
    a: "Yes. We follow a controlled e-waste process and keep dangerous goods separate. See our [E-waste policy](/legal/ewaste-disposal/)."

> **TL;DR:** Load-shedding (**beurtkrag**) accelerates battery wear and exposes weak packs. If you notice a swollen case, short run-time or sudden shutdowns, **stop charging**, back up your files and book a **safe replacement**. We’ll fit the new pack, test charging, and dispose of the old battery through a lawful e-waste stream.

## Why load-shedding wears batteries faster

Frequent charge/flat cycles, heat and brownouts stress lithium-ion cells. Laptops used as “desktops” on the charger also degrade if they run hot near 100% for months. Signs the pack is at end-of-life:

- Short run-time even after a full charge  
- Abrupt shutdown at 20–40%  
- “Service battery” or “Replace soon” warnings  
- **Physical swelling**: raised trackpad/keys, case gaps, or the laptop rocking on a flat table

If swelling is present, **don’t keep using it**. Pressure can crack the trackpad or, in worst cases, puncture the cell.

## Safe steps right now

1. **Power down & unplug.** Don’t place a heavy bag on the lid.  
2. **Back up essentials.** Cloud (OneDrive/Google Drive) or an external USB drive. Need help? We can set this up: **[Cloud backup setup](/services/cloud-backup-setup/)**.  
3. **Don’t puncture or “deflate.”** That’s dangerous and irreversible.  
4. **Arrange a bench check.** We’ll confirm the pack model, health and charging circuit and quote before work.

## How we source and fit batteries (what you can expect)

- **Model-matched parts.** We identify the exact pack code and propose **OEM or high-grade compatible** options with warranty (typically **3–12 months**).  
- **Bench-safe swap.** Anti-static handling, adhesives/fasteners replaced as needed, and connectors inspected for heat damage.  
- **Health check after fit.** Charge/discharge test, firmware/bios battery relearn if the model requires it.  
- **Thermal clean if needed.** If fan vents are clogged, we’ll recommend a quick clean to prevent heat-related capacity loss.

## Load-shedding survival tips (beurtkrag)

- **Work in bursts on battery-saver.** Drop screen brightness; close heavy apps (video editing, VM).  
- **Use a small UPS or power bank** rated for laptops (USB-C PD 60–100W) to ride short outages.  
- **Avoid deep cycles.** Try to keep charge between **20%–80%** when possible; heat and 0% runs shorten life.  
- **Ventilation matters.** Don’t block the underside on blankets/soft couches during outages.  
- **Spare chargers & cables.** Keep one at home and one in the bag to reduce strain on ports.

## Lawful disposal & POPIA

Old packs and damaged electronics **must not** go to general refuse. We separate and route them through accredited e-waste streams. If your device contains personal data we’re not servicing, request a **data wipe** or certified destruction of storage:

- E-waste handling → **[E-waste policy](/legal/ewaste-disposal/)**  
- Certificate of Data Destruction (for storage devices) → **[Certified Wipe (CoDD)](/services/data-destruction-certified-wipe/)**

---

## Book with confidence (and back up first)

- **Timeframes:** Many swaps are **same/next-day** if the pack is in stock; special models may be **2–4 working days**.  
- **Pricing:** Depends on model and pack grade; we’ll quote before work.  
- **Data safety:** Battery work doesn’t touch your drive, but we strongly recommend a backup beforehand.

  title: "Quarterly 30-minute device-health checklist (safe steps)"
  steps:
    - "Apply OS and browser updates; reboot once. Record build numbers after update."
    - "Update drivers/firmware where recommended by OEM tools (storage/chipset/BIOS). Avoid beta firmware."
    - "Check disk health (SMART/SSD wear) and free space (≥15%). Do not run CHKDSK on a failing drive."
    - "Verify backups: confirm last run and errors; perform a test-restore of one folder to a different location."
    - "Review access: confirm password manager use, enforce MFA for admin/email, remove leavers, audit local admins."
faq:
  - q: "How long should we budget per device?"
    a: "About 30 minutes of touch time. Large feature updates may run in the background; we schedule after hours to reduce disruption."
  - q: "Can this be done remotely?"
    a: "Yes. Most checks and fixes are remote. On-site is only needed for stubborn firmware issues or hardware swaps."
  - q: "What if SMART shows warnings or the PC is crashing?"
    a: "Stop heavy use, capture a backup, and plan a drive replacement. We can image the disk and migrate you to a fresh SSD."
  - q: "Do you follow POPIA and sign NDAs?"
    a: "Yes. We apply least-privilege access, document purpose/retention, and can sign an NDA. Backups and any logs are handled securely."
  - q: "Do you offer ongoing plans?"
    a: "Yes—**SME Care Plans** are rolling out soon (priority updates, backup checks, monthly reporting). Ask to be added to the waitlist."

> **TL;DR:** Spend **30 minutes per device each quarter** and you’ll avoid most outages. Update OS/drivers, check **SMART & free space**, verify **backups with a test restore**, enforce **MFA** and clean up access. We can run the whole pass **remotely** and send a tidy report.

## Who this helps
SMEs in **Technopark** and the **Stellenbosch CBD** with 5–50 devices who need practical, budget-aware maintenance that reduces Monday-morning emergencies and supports POPIA responsibilities without buying a full stack of tooling.

## The 30-minute checklist (with ZAR time/cost)

| Step | What you do | Time | Typical ZAR (remote) |
|---|---|:--:|:--:|
| 1. OS & browser updates | Apply security updates; reboot | 5–8 min | R80–R120 |
| 2. Drivers/Firmware | Storage/chipset, GPU if needed; BIOS/UEFI if recommended | 4–6 min | R60–R100 |
| 3. Disk health & space | Check SMART/SSD wear; keep ≥15% free | 3–5 min | R50–R80 |
| 4. Backups (test-restore) | Confirm last run & errors; restore a small folder | 5–7 min | R80–R120 |
| 5. Passwords & MFA | Confirm password manager; enforce MFA; remove leavers | 4–6 min | R60–R100 |
| 6. Asset notes | Record device/user/serial/warranty; changes since last check | 2–3 min | R30–R50 |

> Prefer us to run it for you? Book a **[Quarterly Device Health Check](/services/quarterly-device-health-check-remote/)** for a scripted pass and a short report.

## Step-by-step details

### 1) Update the OS (then reboot)
- **Windows:** Settings → Windows Update → Check for updates.  
- **macOS:** System Settings → General → Software Update.  
Apply security patches first; defer feature upgrades during trading hours if needed.

### 2) Drivers & firmware (only what’s recommended)
Use OEM tools (Dell Command / HP Support Assistant / Lenovo Vantage / ASUS) to install **storage/chipset** drivers and any recommended **BIOS/UEFI** updates. Avoid beta firmware on production devices. Record versions in asset notes.

### 3) Disk health & free space
Read **SMART** (CrystalDiskInfo or SSD vendor utility). If health shows **Caution/Bad**, back up and plan a replacement. Keep **≥15% free space**—below that, Windows/macOS thrash and updates fail.

### 4) Backups that actually restore
A backup isn’t a backup until you’ve **test-restored**. Confirm last run, size and **zero errors**; restore a small folder to another location to verify permissions and paths.  
Need a solid plan? Book **[Cloud backup setup](/services/cloud-backup-setup/)** (3-2-1 with a simple, tested restore).

### 5) Passwords, MFA & leavers
- Enforce **MFA** on email/admin portals and remote tools.  
- Confirm a **password manager** is in use (shared vaults for shared creds).  
- Remove **leavers** and audit local admins quarterly.  
If you need help, book a **[Remote support session](/services/remote-support-setup/)**.

### 6) Asset notes (keep it simple)
Track **device name, user, serial, OS build, warranty date** and any changes since last quarter. A two-column sheet beats memory when you need warranty or insurance info.

## When to escalate (so you don’t lose a day)
- **SMART warnings**, rising reallocated sectors, or clicking drives  
- **Update failures**, blue screens, boot loops  
- **Backups failing** repeatedly  
- Frequent freezes or **Wi-Fi drops** under load

We can stabilise remotely, then recommend parts or next steps. Start with a **[Remote support session](/services/remote-support-setup/)**.

## Budgeting & next steps

- Quarterly pass done-for-you → **[Quarterly Device Health Check](/services/quarterly-device-health-check-remote/)**  
- Robust backup plan → **[Cloud backup setup](/services/cloud-backup-setup/)**  
- Ad-hoc fixes & tune-ups → **[Remote support session](/services/remote-support-setup/)**  
- **SME Care Plans** → coming soon (priority updates, backup checks, monthly reporting). Ask to join the pilot.

## Final word
A disciplined **30-minute quarterly** routine prevents most outages and keeps you compliant. If you’d like us to run it and send a clear report—with costs and upgrade paths—we’ll do it **remotely**, quietly, and on a schedule that fits your team.

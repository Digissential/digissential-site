## About the university belt

From **Victoria Street** past **Neelsie** toward **Coetzenburg**, this area mixes lecture halls, labs, and busy student flats. When devices fail between classes or while compiling research, we’re nearby with clear pricing, same-day diagnostics, and pick-ups from residences or faculty offices.

### Common issues we solve here

- **Flickering or cracked screens** after backpack bumps  
- **Batteries that won’t last a lecture** or fail to charge reliably  
- **Overheating & sudden shutdowns** during CAD, MATLAB, or video renders  
- **Wi-Fi dead zones** in multi-room flats and shared houses  
- **Malware & phishing cleanup** after fake “software updates”  
- **Data recovery** for dissertations, lab work, and project drives

> Need help fast? Call **066 425 6314** for same-day diagnostics or a campus-area pick-up.

## Landmarks & micro-areas we serve

- **Victoria Street**, **Neelsie Student Centre**, **Bib (Library)**  
- **Coetzenburg** sports complex and surrounds  
- Residences near **Huis Marais**, **Wilgenhof**, **Irene**, **Huis ten Bosch**  
- Edges toward **Engineering**, **Arts & Social Sciences**, and admin buildings

## Service highlights

- **Written quotes** before work begins  
- **POPIA-safe handling** for all devices and data  
- **Genuine parts when available**; fit-for-purpose otherwise  
- **Pick-up & return** in the university belt on request  
- **Student-friendly advice** to prevent repeat failures

## Quick tips if your device just failed

- **Fan roaring during compiles?** Pause heavy apps and elevate the laptop; a thermal clean and fresh paste can drop temps dramatically.  
- **Wi-Fi fine in lounge, weak in bedroom?** Skip plug-in boosters; a small mesh kit placed well is faster and more stable.  
- **Spill on keyboard?** Power off, unplug, and avoid charging—liquid + power risks board damage. We’ll assess and clean safely.

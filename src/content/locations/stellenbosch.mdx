## Why the Stellenbosch hub?

We built this hub around the way the town works: quick turnarounds for students and researchers, reliable support for SMEs, and convenient pick-ups for families. If you’re based anywhere from Middedorp to Techno Park, we’re designed to keep your devices — and your day — moving.

## What we fix, daily

- **Laptops & desktops:** boot issues, slow systems, startup loops, overheating, noisy fans.  
- **Hardware repairs:** screens, batteries, keyboards, charging ports, storage upgrades (SSD).  
- **Data services:** file recovery, backup setup, drive cloning and health checks.  
- **Security & hygiene:** malware/virus removal, patching, safe-browsing setup, password guidance.  
- **Wi-Fi & networking:** dead-spots, router swaps, fibre ONT issues, SSID and guest networks.  
- **Remote support:** quick fixes without a visit when it’s safe to do so.

## How service works

1. **Book or call.** We’ll set expectations and confirm whether a pick-up, drop-off, or on-site visit suits you.  
2. **Diagnostics.** We run a non-destructive inspection and confirm parts/pricing before repair.  
3. **Repair or recovery.** We only proceed with your approval and keep you updated.  
4. **Return & follow-up.** Collect, or we deliver. We’ll share simple care tips to prevent repeat issues.

## Students, researchers, and parents

We understand deadlines and exam weeks. If your machine fails the day before a hand-in, tell us — we’ll triage appropriately, keep communication clear, and try to save what matters most first.

## Techno Park & local SMEs

Need dependable IT without a full-time team? We help with device fleet setup, email/security baselines, network clean-ups, and ad-hoc or scheduled site visits. Remote helpdesk is available for recurring support.

## Coverage

We serve **all of Stellenbosch**, including Stellenbosch Central/Middedorp, Die Boord, Dalsig, Mostertsdrift, Krigeville, Brandwacht, Paradyskloof, Karindal, Uniepark, La Colline, Onder Papegaaiberg, Welgevonden, Cloetesville, Idas Valley, Kayamandi, Jamestown, Techno Park, and De Zalze. If you’re outside town, nearby pick-ups are available on request.

    a: "We pick your key folders (Docs, Desktop, Photos, school or work files) and skip junk like temp/cache."
  - q: "Can you back up an external drive?"
    a: "Often yes, if the provider supports it. We’ll confirm before we set it up."
  - q: "What about my data cap?"
    a: "We seed slowly at first and schedule big uploads overnight. We can also start on a local network to save data."
  - q: "Do you keep old versions?"
    a: "Yes, most clouds keep versions. We set a smart window so you can roll back accidental changes."

**TL;DR:** We set up automatic, encrypted cloud backups, test a restore, and leave you with a simple guide.  
**Local:** Popular with SU students, busy homes in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** teams who can’t risk lost files.

### Symptoms we fix
- “I don’t have a backup. If my laptop dies, I’m sunk.”  
- Files only live on a USB stick that goes missing  
- OneDrive/Google Drive/iCloud is full or not syncing right  
- Same file in five places; no idea which one is current  
- Ransomware fears or “what if it gets stolen?” stress

### How we do it (at a glance)
We talk about what matters: school work, client folders, photos, POS data.  
We help you pick a cloud that fits. Then we:
1) Install and sign in  
2) Choose folders to include (and what to skip)  
3) Turn on encryption and version history  
4) Set a schedule and bandwidth caps  
5) Seed the first backup and watch it start  
6) Do a **test restore** so you see your files come back  
You get a one-page guide with screenshots. No tech speak.

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Labour:** **R250** per machine for setup and the first test restore  
- **Cloud plan:** Billed by the provider (month or year). We’ll show the current price before you choose.  
- **Turnaround:** Often **same day** once the account is ready and the first sync begins. Big uploads continue in the background.

### Do-nots (to protect your data)
- Don’t rely on a **sync folder** as your only “backup.” If you delete it, it’s gone everywhere.  
- Don’t keep your only copy on a single USB stick. They get lost.  
- Don’t write your encryption key on a sticky note that can vanish.  
- Don’t unplug an external drive while it’s backing up.

### When to stop DIY & call us
- Drive shows errors or makes clicking sounds  
- Ransomware pop-ups, or files suddenly end in weird extensions  
- Cloud app is stuck “pending” for days  
- iCloud/Drive created endless duplicates and you’re scared to clean it  
- You changed laptops and nothing matches anymore

### Real-world notes from around town
- **SU first-year (Huis Marais):** Laptop stolen at the Neelsie. Because we set cloud backup the week before, he signed in and got his essay back in minutes.  
- **Die Boord family:** Photos spread over phones, a desktop, and an old laptop. We pulled them into one library and set phone auto-upload. No more “where is that birthday picture?”  
- **Technopark SME:** Staff saved files on Desktops only. We moved key work into a shared, backed-up folder and set easy restores. Staff kept their habits; data got safer.

### Simple care tips
- Keep your laptop on power overnight once a week so the backup can finish  
- Do a small restore test once a term (we show you how)  
- Add your phone’s camera roll to auto-upload — it’s painless and saves memories  
- When changing PCs, ask us to point the new one at the same backup set so history stays intact

### Need help choosing a provider?
We’ll compare a few options in plain words: storage size, price, version history, external-drive support, and how easy it is to restore. You pick. We set it up. If you already pay for a cloud (e.g., with your school or work account), we can use that and save money.

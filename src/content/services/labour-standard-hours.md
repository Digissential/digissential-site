**TL;DR:** Need help that doesn’t fit a fixed service? We handle it in simple 30-minute blocks during business hours.  
**Local:** Useful for SU students, homes in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** teams when a task is unique.

### Examples of work covered
- Sort out odd app issues or settings that don’t stick  
- Tidy a messy user profile or start-up list  
- Printer/scanner quirks, shared folders, or small network tweaks  
- One-off training: email basics, file habits, quick “how do I…?”  
- Light scripting or batch jobs (rename, move, back up)  
- Vendor calls where we sit on the line and fix with them

### How it works (at a glance)
1) **Quick chat:** goal, scope, and a time estimate  
2) **Work the plan:** remote first if fastest; on-site if needed  
3) **Update:** we send short notes as we go  
4) **Handover:** what changed, what to watch, and next steps

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Rate:** **R450/hr**, billed in **30-minute** blocks (30-minute minimum)  
- **Hours:** Weekdays in standard business hours  
- **On-site:** A small call-out may apply if we travel; we confirm first  
- **Urgent after 17:30 / weekends?** See [/services/labour-after-hours-emergency/](/services/labour-after-hours-emergency/) or add [/services/expedited-service-fee/](/services/expedited-service-fee/)

### Do-nots (save time and money)
- Don’t stack three “PC optimizers” — they slow us down  
- Don’t guess admin passwords; we’ll need the right ones  
- Don’t start big updates right before we arrive  
- Don’t skip a quick backup before risky changes — see [/services/data-backup-full-system-image/](/services/data-backup-full-system-image/)

### When to stop DIY & call us
- Settings keep undoing themselves after reboot  
- Print jobs vanish or sit “queued” forever  
- Shared folders work on one PC but not the others  
- Outlook profile crashes or won’t add accounts

### Real stories around town
- **SU first-year (Huis Marais):** One hour to clean a broken profile, set OneDrive, and calm start-up apps.  
- **Die Boord home office:** 45 minutes to fix printer drivers and set a proper scan-to-PDF path.  
- **Technopark front desk:** 30 minutes to map a shared folder and fix permissions so invoices printed again.

### What we’ll need
- The **device and charger** (if on-site)  
- **Passwords/keys** we might need (admin, BitLocker, mail)  
- A short note on the goal and what changed recently

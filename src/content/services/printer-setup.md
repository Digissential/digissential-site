**TL;DR:** We add your printer the right way, print a test page, and—if it’s all-in-one—test scan too.  
**Local:** Handy for SU student digs, homes in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** offices.

### Problems we fix
- “Driver unavailable” or stuck installs  
- Prints from one PC but not the others  
- Wi-Fi setup loops or won’t see the network  
- Wrong paper size, wrong tray, no duplex  
- Scanner won’t show up in apps

### What’s included
- Install the **correct driver** (maker-approved), remove clashing junk  
- Set clean **defaults** (A4, tray, duplex if supported)  
- **Test page** from your PC; if AIO, test **scan to PDF/JPG**  
- Short notes so you know how to add another device later

### How we do it (at a glance)
1) **Connect** by USB or Wi-Fi (right band and password)  
2) **Load drivers** from HP/Canon/Brother/Epson/etc. — no random packs  
3) **Name & defaults:** simple, consistent name; A4; duplex if your model can  
4) **Test:** print a page; scan on AIO; try a second app  
5) **Notes:** where to click next time and how to add more PCs

Plain words. No tech talk.

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Setup fee:** **R200** for one device  
- **Extras:** **+R80** per extra PC/phone/tablet you want added  
- **On-site option:** Add [/services/on-site-surcharge-within-20km/](/services/on-site-surcharge-within-20km/) if we come to you  
- **Turnaround:** Often **same day** (extra devices take ~15–30 min each)

### Do-nots (save time and ink)
- Don’t use the generic Windows class driver if the maker has a better one  
- Don’t install the full **bloat suite** if you only need print/scan  
- Don’t place the printer on a **guest** Wi-Fi — many guests can’t see PCs  
- Don’t hide the printer behind metal or glass; signal drops hard

### When to stop DIY & call us
- “Driver unavailable” or queue stuck on **0%**  
- Prints from app A but not app B  
- Wi-Fi printer drops off after sleep  
- Scan app can’t find the device  
- Duplex shows in menus but won’t work

### Real stories around town
- **SU first-year (Huis Marais):** “Driver unavailable.” We cleared old packages and loaded the right one. Test page done in minutes.  
- **Die Boord home office:** Printer worked on Mum’s PC but not Dad’s. We added it on both, set A4/duplex, and scan-to-PDF to a shared folder.  
- **Technopark front desk:** Wi-Fi printer kept dropping. We moved it off guest Wi-Fi, set a fixed IP, and it stayed online.

### Simple tips
- Keep it on the **same Wi-Fi** as your PCs (not guest)  
- Use **A4** as the default here in SA; saves paper mix-ups  
- Replace ink/toner with the model the printer expects  
- Put the printer where the signal is strong and clear

### What to prepare
- Printer, power/USB cable, and Wi-Fi name/password  
- Your PC or laptop (and phone if you want mobile print)  
- Any vendor account details if needed (HP/Canon/Brother/Epson)

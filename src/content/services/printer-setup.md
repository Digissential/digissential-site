bullets:
  - Install & test on 1 device
  - +R80 per extra device
  - Correct driver & default settings
  - Test page and scan (if AIO)
faq:
  - q: "Do you support Wi-Fi printers?"
    a: "Yes—USB or Wi-Fi. We’ll connect it cleanly and avoid the vendor bloat you don’t need."
  - q: "Can you add it to more PCs?"
    a: "Absolutely—each extra device is +R80. We’ll keep defaults consistent."

## What’s included
- Install the **correct driver** (vendor-approved) and remove conflicting bloat.  
- Configure sensible defaults (paper size, tray, duplex where supported).  
- Print a test page and—if all-in-one—test **scan** as well.

## Details

### When this service is ideal
- New printer or a replacement on a fresh PC.  
- Your current printer works on one device but refuses on another.

### What to prepare
- Printer, power/USB/Wi-Fi details, and any vendor account if required.  
- For Wi-Fi printers, ensure the printer is near your router for initial setup.

### Turnaround
Typically **same day** (15–30 minutes per device after the first).

**TL;DR:** We back up your files, install a fresh Windows, then put your files back and set calm, safe settings.  
**Local:** Common for SU students, homes in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** teams after malware, slowdowns, or a messy update.

### Problems we fix
- Windows so broken that fixes won’t stick  
- Pop-ups, crashes, or weird errors after a bad update  
- PC is slow and full of trial apps and junk  
- You want a fresh start but don’t want to lose files

### What you get
- **Pre-install backup** of your user folders  
- **Clean Windows install** with the right **drivers** and updates  
- **Restore** of your files and a quick open test  
- A light **privacy & security** baseline (Defender tuned, safe browser defaults)  
- **Plain notes** on what changed and where your files live

### How we do it (at a glance)
1) **Check-in:** goals, special folders, app list you’ll want later  
2) **Backup:** copy your user data to safe storage  
3) **Install:** clean Windows, load drivers (Wi-Fi, audio, graphics, chipset)  
4) **Update & tidy:** apply updates, trim trial junk, set calm defaults  
5) **Restore:** put your files back and test open/save  
6) **Safety pass:** basic hardening (Defender, SmartScreen, firewall sanity)  
7) **Handover:** short notes and simple tips

Plain words. No tech talk.

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Service fee:** **R900** (backup → reinstall → restore)  
- **Turnaround:** **Same day to next day** (data size and updates can add time)  
- **Helpful add-ons:**  
  - Faster drive: [/services/ssd-upgrade-bundle-clone-swap/](/services/ssd-upgrade-bundle-clone-swap/)  
  - App installs: [/services/software-installation-standard/](/services/software-installation-standard/) or [/services/software-installation-bulk/](/services/software-installation-bulk/)

- **See fees:** [/legal/standard-fees/](/legal/standard-fees/)

### Do-nots (save time and stress)
- Don’t factory-reset if you care about files and don’t have a backup  
- Don’t run random “cleaners” that promise magic fixes  
- Don’t keep guessing passwords if **BitLocker** shows—bring the key  
- Don’t force power-offs during updates; it can corrupt things

### When to stop DIY & call us
- Windows loops on startup repair or update rollback  
- Browser pop-ups and toolbars keep coming back  
- “Disk 100%” all the time and basic fixes didn’t help  
- You need a clean slate but must keep your files

### Real stories around town
- **SU first-year (Huis Marais):** Malware wrecked login. We backed up user folders, did a clean install, restored files, and set safer defaults. Back to class the next day.  
- **Die Boord family PC:** Years of trial apps made it crawl. Fresh install + file restore and it felt new.  
- **Technopark laptop:** Bad update stuck in a loop. Fresh Windows, drivers, files back, and meetings ran on time.

### Simple tips
- Keep one strong passphrase in a password manager  
- Let Windows update on a quiet night each week  
- Add a light cloud backup—photos and docs are precious  
- Pin daily apps to the taskbar and unpin the rest

### What to prepare
- **Space** for a temporary backup (we can supply storage if needed)  
- **BitLocker key** if your PC shows the prompt  
- **App installers/keys** for paid tools you want added after  
- **Wi-Fi password** for first connect

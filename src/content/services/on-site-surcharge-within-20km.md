**TL;DR:** We come to you within **20km** of Stellenbosch. The surcharge covers travel and logistics; actual work is billed at normal rates.  
**Local:** Common for homes in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, SU student houses in **Idas Valley**, and **Technopark** offices that can’t spare a trip to our bench.

### When on-site makes sense
- No internet, so remote help won’t fly  
- Mesh Wi-Fi planning, printer placement, tricky cabling  
- Business devices that must stay on the premises  
- House layouts where a walk-through matters

### How it works (at a glance)
1) **Quick chat:** goal, address, and parking/gate details  
2) **Quote:** confirm the on-site surcharge and expected labour  
3) **Visit:** arrive in the agreed window and get to work  
4) **Update:** simple status notes; if parts are needed, we say so before we buy

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **On-site surcharge (≤20km):** **R300**  
- **Beyond 20km:** **+R8/km** (round-trip)  
- **Parking/tolls:** at cost (we’ll confirm first)  
- **Labour:** billed separately — see [/services/labour-standard-hours/](/services/labour-standard-hours/)  
- **After-hours?** use [/services/labour-after-hours-emergency/](/services/labour-after-hours-emergency/)

### Do-nots (save time and money)
- Don’t dismantle gear before we arrive — small screws get lost  
- Don’t hide the router in a cupboard; we’ll need access  
- Don’t plan a tight 10-minute window if there’s **access control** or a guard sign-in  
- Don’t change passwords mid-visit — tell us first

### What we’ll need
- A contact person on site and a working number  
- Gate/parking info and any **access codes**  
- For network jobs: ISP details (PPPoE if used) and your Wi-Fi name/password  
- Admin passwords for PCs or printers we’re fixing

### What’s included
- Travel and on-site logistics inside **20km**  
- Jobs beyond **20km** billed at **R8/km (round-trip)**, plus parking/tolls at cost  
- Clear notes on work done and next steps

### Handy links
- **Standard hourly work:** [/services/labour-standard-hours/](/services/labour-standard-hours/)  
- **Remote first aid (often faster):** [/services/remote-support-setup/](/services/remote-support-setup/)

draft: false
category: "Hardware"
summary: "Tighten loose hinges, reinforce posts, and quiet creaks so your laptop feels solid again."
price: R350
featured: false
bullets:
  - Tighten/replace missing screws and standoffs
  - Re-seat hinges; adjust friction where design allows
  - Plastic post/insert reinforcement when viable
  - Crack check with repair or part-replacement options
faq:
  - q: "My hinge post is broken—can it be repaired?"
    a: "Often yes. We clean the area and add plastic-safe reinforcement or heat-set inserts. If the break is large, a new palmrest/top-case may be needed."
  - q: "Will it feel like new?"
    a: "Usually much better. On older, brittle plastics we set honest expectations."
  - q: "Do you just use glue?"
    a: "No. We prep the plastic, pin or insert where possible, and use the right compounds. Quick super glue alone won’t last."
  - q: "Can this fix screen flicker when I move the lid?"
    a: "If a cable is being pinched, we re-seat and route it. If the cable is damaged, we’ll quote a replacement."
  - q: "How long will I be without the laptop?"
    a: "Tighten/adjust is same day. Reinforcement needs cure time (often overnight)."

**TL;DR:** We tighten the hinges, fix loose posts, and stop the creaks so the screen stays where you set it.  
**Local:** Common for SU students, homes in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** laptops that travel a lot.

### Symptoms we fix
- Wobbly screen or lid that won’t stay up  
- Loud creaks or pops when opening/closing  
- Bottom cover gaps; missing or stripped screws  
- Touchpad or palmrest lifting near the hinge  
- Screen flickers or Wi-Fi drops when you move the lid (cable strain)

### How we do it (at a glance)
1) **Inspect:** hinge mounts, brass inserts, posts, and nearby cables  
2) **Tighten/replace:** correct screws and standoffs; add thread-lock where it helps  
3) **Re-seat/adjust:** set hinge friction where the model allows it  
4) **Reinforce (if cracked):** plastic-safe repair with pins/inserts and proper cure time  
5) **Cable check:** make sure display/Wi-Fi cables aren’t pinched or rubbing  
6) **Test:** open/close cycles, lid angles, and noise check

Plain words. No tech jargon.

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Labour:** **R350** for tighten/adjust on healthy plastics  
- **Reinforcement:** small materials add-on when needed (we confirm first)  
- **Turnaround:** **Same day** for tighten/adjust; **1–2 days** if reinforcement must cure

### Do-nots (save the chassis)
- Don’t keep forcing a stiff hinge — it rips the posts  
- Don’t carry the laptop by the screen  
- Don’t use super glue on load points — it turns brittle  
- Don’t ignore a lid that pushes the touchpad up — it can be a **swollen battery** (stop and call)

### When to stop DIY & call us
- Palmrest or bottom case is cracking at the hinge  
- Lid drops by itself or only opens part way  
- Display flickers or goes black when you move the lid  
- You hear sharp pops from inside the hinge area

### Real stories around town
- **SU res room:** Wobbly lid from missing screws. We fitted the correct set, added thread-lock, and the screen held steady.  
- **Die Boord family laptop:** Creaks and a small crack. We reinforced the post, cured overnight, and it opened smooth the next day.  
- **Technopark sales machine:** Broken insert and torn plastic. We priced a palmrest replacement and kept the user working with a temp tighten.

### Simple care tips
- Open from the **centre** with two hands  
- Keep screws snug; a short check once a term helps  
- Don’t slam the lid or twist it from one corner  
- Keep the laptop off soft beds/sofas that flex the chassis

### What’s included
- Disassembly and hinge mount inspection  
- Tighten and thread-lock where it makes sense  
- Reinforce cracked posts when viable  
- Re-seat cables and a clean fit-up

### Turnaround
- **Same day** for tighten/adjust  
- **1–2 days** if plastic reinforcement needs to cure

### What to bring
- The laptop and **charger**  
- A short note on when it creaks, wobbles, or drops  
- Tell us if there was a **fall** or **spill**

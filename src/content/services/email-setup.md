**TL;DR:** We set up your email the right way, test it, and make it easy to use.  
**Local:** Handy for SU students, homes in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** teams who need mail that just works.

### Problems we fix
- Endless password prompts  
- “Cannot connect to server”  
- Old mail not showing on your phone or laptop  
- Sent items don’t match across devices  
- Calendar or contacts missing

### What’s included
- One email account on one device with secure IMAP/Exchange/SMTP  
- Clean folder view, a simple signature, and a sane sync window  
- Send/receive test and a quick calendar/contacts check (if used)  
- Short notes on where your mail stores and how to add another device

### How we do it (at a glance)
1) **Add account** with the right server settings and ports  
2) **Turn on** 2-step login or app password where your provider uses it  
3) **Pick sync** range (e.g., last 3–12 months) so the app stays fast  
4) **Tidy folders** and set your default “From” and signature  
5) **Test:** send to and from yourself; check calendar/contacts

Plain steps. No tech talk.

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Setup fee:** **R200** for one account on one device  
- **Extras:** **+R80** per extra device or extra account  
- **Turnaround:** Often **same day**; big mailbox syncs keep going in the background

### Do-nots (save time and stress)
- Don’t guess server names from a blog—use the real provider info  
- Don’t pick the old **POP** option if you want mail to match on phone and PC  
- Don’t paste recovery codes into random sites—ask us if unsure  
- Don’t ignore 2-step prompts—set them up; it stops most break-ins

### When to stop DIY & call us
- You changed a password and nothing works now  
- Mail sends but won’t arrive (or lands in Junk)  
- Calendar invites don’t show  
- Outlook profile is corrupt and crashes on start

### Real stories around town
- **SU first-year (Huis Marais):** Mailbox kept asking for a password. The time was off and 2-step wasn’t finished. We fixed both and it stayed signed in.  
- **Die Boord home office:** Sent mail showed on the laptop but not the phone. We moved from POP to IMAP and life got simple again.  
- **Technopark team:** New hire’s Outlook wouldn’t add. We set the right tenant rules, added the account, and meetings synced at once.

### Simple tips
- Write your main email and recovery email on a safe card (not a sticky note on the screen)  
- Keep one strong passphrase in a password manager  
- If mail starts acting odd, don’t delete the whole profile—call us first  
- Use IMAP/Exchange so everything stays in step

### What we’ll need
- Your mailbox **email and password**  
- Your **phone** if you use app-based codes (Authenticator/SMS)  
- Any custom domain details if you use a work address

summary: "Plan access-point placement, cut dead zones, and install a mesh that covers your whole space."

bullets:
  - Site walk-through and coverage check
  - AP placement and channel plan
  - Install and adopt mesh nodes
  - Post-install validation with notes
faq:
  - q: "How many nodes do I need?"
    a: "It depends on walls, floors, and layout. After a quick walk-through we’ll suggest a sensible number."
  - q: "Can you work with my preferred brand?"
    a: "Yes — UniFi, TP-Link/Deco, ASUS, Eero and others. We’ll weigh pros/cons for your space and budget."
  - q: "Do you support Ethernet backhaul?"
    a: "If we can run cable between nodes, backhaul gives better speed and stability. If not, we tune a solid wireless backhaul."
  - q: "Will you replace my ISP router?"
    a: "Sometimes. We can bridge the ISP router or keep it and place the mesh behind it. We’ll pick the best path on site."
  - q: "Guest Wi-Fi and parental controls?"
    a: "Yes. We set a guest SSID and simple family rules where the brand supports it."

**TL;DR:** We plan where each node should go, install the mesh, and test roaming so Wi-Fi works in every room.  
**Local:** Great for SU student houses in **Idas Valley**, families in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** offices that need steady calls.

### Problems we fix
- Strong speed near the router, weak in bedrooms or the kitchen  
- Zoom/Teams stutters or drops when you walk around  
- Printers or smart TVs fall off the network  
- Old range extenders make new network names and slow things down  
- Garden flat or outbuilding has no signal

### How we do it (at a glance)
1) **Quick site check:** walls, floors, and where power lives  
2) **Plan:** node placement, channels, and backhaul (wireless or Ethernet)  
3) **Install:** mount or place nodes, set one SSID + a guest SSID  
4) **Tune:** channels, transmit power, roaming and band-steering  
5) **Test:** speed spots, hand-off while walking, printer/TV joins  
6) **Notes:** short write-up with your network name, password, and simple tips

Plain words. No network jargon.

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Planning fee:** **R300** (this page)  
- **Install labour:** quoted after the walk-through (typical **1.5–3 hours** for 2–3 nodes)  
- **Hardware:** billed at store price; we share options before you buy  
- **Turnaround:** Often **same day** for 2–3 nodes; bigger homes may need a half-day  
- **See fees:** [/legal/standard-fees/](/legal/standard-fees/)

### Do-nots (save time and money)
- Don’t chain cheap **extenders**; they cut speed in half each hop  
- Don’t hide nodes in cupboards or behind TVs — signal hates metal and glass  
- Don’t put all nodes in a straight line far apart — overlap matters  
- Don’t leave ISP routers on auto everything — we’ll set calm, clean channels

### When to stop DIY & call us
- Speed is fine at the router but awful two rooms away  
- Video calls drop when you move between rooms  
- Smart gear (TV/Sonos/printer) won’t stay online  
- You tried a mesh and it still feels patchy

### Real stories around town
- **SU digs (Idas Valley):** Two brick walls killed the lounge signal. We placed three Deco nodes with smart backhaul. Calls went smooth, even in the kitchen.  
- **Die Boord double-storey:** Router hid in a cupboard. We moved it out, added two nodes, and set a guest SSID. Netflix stopped buffering.  
- **Technopark office:** Boardroom Wi-Fi died when full. We added a ceiling AP on wired backhaul and tuned channels. Meetings stayed clear.

### Simple care tips
- Keep nodes in the open at chest height if you can  
- Update mesh firmware when the app suggests it  
- Use a small UPS for the fibre ONT and main node to ride out load-shedding  
- Label your SSID and password on a card in the study

### What’s included
- **Site assessment** and a simple placement + channel plan  
- **Install/adoption** of mesh nodes; main + guest SSID  
- **Post-install checks** for speed and roaming  
- **Written notes** with your setup and a few easy tips

### What we’ll need
- Access to your **fibre ONT/router** and admin details if we bridge  
- A floor plan or a quick walk-through  
- Your **ISP login** if PPPoE is used (we’ll ask first)

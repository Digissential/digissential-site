**TL;DR:** We turn a brand-new PC into a ready-to-work machine—fast, tidy, and safe.  
**Local:** Popular with SU students, homes in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** teams rolling out laptops.

### Problems we solve
- “New laptop is slow out the box”  
- Endless prompts and trial apps you don’t want  
- Email not added, bookmarks missing, printer won’t show  
- OneDrive/Google Drive syncing the wrong folders  
- Privacy and updates set to noisy defaults

### What you get
- First-run setup and **Windows updates**  
- **Drivers** for graphics, Wi-Fi, audio, chipset  
- **User profile** made clean (sensible desktop and folders)  
- **Email** added (Outlook/Windows Mail/webmail) with a simple signature  
- **Privacy & security baseline** with calm settings  
- Short handover notes in plain words

### How we do it (at a glance)
1) **Check-in:** goals, apps you use, and accounts you want added  
2) **Update Windows** and load the right drivers  
3) **Tidy start-up** and remove junk trials  
4) **Add email** and set a clean folder view + signature  
5) **Set basics:** browser, defaults, and safe settings  
6) **Quick tests:** Wi-Fi, sound, camera, print page, and a reboot  
7) **Handover:** simple notes and tips you can keep

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Setup fee:** **R350** per new PC/laptop  
- **Turnaround:** Often **same day** (updates can add time)  
- **Helpful add-ons:**  
  - Move your files: [/services/data-migration/](/services/data-migration/) — **R450**  
  - Daily safety: [/services/cloud-backup-setup/](/services/cloud-backup-setup/) — **R250**  
  - Safer defaults: [/services/cybersecurity-hardening/](/services/cybersecurity-hardening/) — **R450**

### Do-nots (save time and stress)
- Don’t click every pop-up that offers a “cleaner” or “booster”  
- Don’t install five antivirus apps—they fight each other  
- Don’t skip updates forever—pick a calm time and let them run  
- Don’t guess email server settings if it keeps asking for a password

### When to stop DIY & call us
- Printer won’t add or says “driver unavailable”  
- OneDrive/Google Drive is full or syncing the wrong stuff  
- Bluetooth, camera, or sound missing after updates  
- Windows feels slow on a brand-new device

### Real stories around town
- **SU first-year (Huis Marais):** New laptop full of trial apps. We cleaned start-up, added Outlook and OneDrive, and it booted quick for lectures.  
- **Die Boord family:** Two new PCs. We set profiles for each person, added a shared printer, and set cloud sync for photos. No more “where’s my file?”  
- **Technopark onboarding:** Five laptops for new hires. We set drivers, mail, and safe defaults the same day so work started on time.

### Simple tips
- Use one strong passphrase in a password manager  
- Pin your daily apps to the taskbar and unpin what you don’t use  
- Keep the laptop on power during big updates  
- Do a small backup once a week (we can set it up)

### What to prepare
- **Accounts:** Microsoft/Google sign-ins and 2-step codes  
- **Apps:** installers/keys for paid software (Office, Adobe, etc.)  
- **Peripherals:** printer/scanner model if you want them added

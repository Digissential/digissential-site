**TL;DR:** We wipe the system drive and install a fresh Windows to fix deep problems fast. **No file backup** in this service.  
**Need your files kept?** Use [/services/windows-reinstall-and-backup/](/services/windows-reinstall-and-backup/).  
**Local:** Common for SU students, homes in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** teams after heavy malware or broken updates.

### Problems we fix
- Severe malware and weird pop-ups that keep coming back  
- Windows repair loops and blue screens after updates  
- System files corrupt; fixes don’t stick  
- Years of trial apps and junk that made the PC crawl

### What you get
- **Clean format** of the Windows drive  
- Fresh **Windows install** with the right **drivers**  
- **Updates** applied and calm defaults set  
- A light **privacy & security** baseline  
- **Plain notes** on what changed and what to do next

### How we do it (at a glance)
1) **Check-in:** goals, keys, and any BitLocker status  
2) **Wipe & install:** clean Windows and maker drivers  
3) **Update & tidy:** safe patches, no junk add-ons  
4) **Basics set:** browser, defaults, simple safety toggles  
5) **Handover:** short notes and next steps

Plain words. No tech talk.

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Service fee:** **R650**  
- **Turnaround:** Often **same day** (updates can add time)  
- **Helpful add-ons:**  
  - Keep your files next time: [/services/windows-reinstall-and-backup/](/services/windows-reinstall-and-backup/)  
  - Add your core apps: [/services/software-installation-standard/](/services/software-installation-standard/) or [/services/software-installation-bulk/](/services/software-installation-bulk/)  
  - Safer daily use: [/services/cybersecurity-hardening/](/services/cybersecurity-hardening/)

### Do-nots (save time and stress)
- Don’t choose this if you need files — pick the **+ Backup** service  
- Don’t guess BitLocker keys; have them ready  
- Don’t force power-offs during updates  
- Don’t install “miracle cleaners” right after a fresh build

### When to stop DIY & call us
- Windows loops “Preparing Automatic Repair” or rolls back updates  
- Malware returns right after you “remove” it  
- System files are broken and SFC/DISM won’t help  
- The PC is too slow to even start a backup

### Real stories around town
- **SU first-year (Huis Marais):** Bad malware, no files needed. Clean install same day and back to class.  
- **Die Boord family PC:** Years of clutter. Fresh install made it feel new.  
- **Technopark laptop:** Update loop before a meeting. New Windows + drivers, then apps added — on time for work.

### Simple tips
- Keep one strong passphrase in a password manager  
- Let Windows update on a quiet evening each week  
- Add a light cloud backup for Documents and Photos  
- Pin daily apps to the taskbar; unpin the rest

### What to bring
- **Device and power lead**  
- **Windows key** or Microsoft account (if no digital license)  
- **BitLocker recovery key** if your PC shows it  
- **Installers/keys** for paid apps you want added after

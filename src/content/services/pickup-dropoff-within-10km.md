**TL;DR:** We collect your device and bring it back when done—simple, tidy, and within **10km** of Stellenbosch.  
**Local:** Handy for SU students in **Idas Valley**, homes in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** offices.

### When this helps
- You’re slammed at work or stuck without transport  
- You’re arranging a repair for family or staff  
- You’d like us to fetch a desktop, monitor, or printer that’s a pain to carry

### How it works (at a glance)
1) **Book a window:** share your address, contact name, and a phone number  
2) **Handover check:** we note the model/serial and take quick photos  
3) **Bench time:** diagnostics/repairs happen in shop (we’ll quote first)  
4) **Return:** we bring it back, do a quick power-on, and get your sign-off

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Pickup + return (≤10km):** **R150**  
- **Beyond 10km:** we quote a fair travel fee  
- **Notes:** This is transport only; diagnostics and repairs are billed at normal rates  
  - Daytime hourly work: [/services/labour-standard-hours/](/services/labour-standard-hours/)  
  - Need speed? Add [/services/expedited-service-fee/](/services/expedited-service-fee/)

### Do-nots (to save time and stress)
- Don’t leave tiny dongles in loose pockets—tape or bag them  
- Don’t hand over extra gear we won’t need (keep spare cables at home)  
- Don’t send passwords on paper—have them ready to type when we return  
- Don’t power a device with a **swollen battery**; tell us so we can move it safely

### What to have ready
- **Charger/power cable** (laptops/printers)  
- **Login info** if testing needs it (you can enter it yourself on return)  
- Gate/parking details and a **contact person** for the handover  
- For desktops: note which screen/keyboard/mouse you want us to test with

### After pickup
We’ll message you with the bench ETA and quote before any paid work. When the job is done, we return the device and give a short, plain-English note of what was done.

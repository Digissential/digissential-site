## What’s included
- **Pickup and return** of your device within **10km**.  
- Handover checklist and secure transport.

## Details

### When this is ideal
- You’re short on time or don’t have transport.  
- You’re coordinating repairs for someone else (family/staff).

### Notes
For distances beyond 10km we’ll quote a fair travel fee. We do not open or test devices during pickup—diagnostics are done on the bench.

title: "Data Destruction (Certified Wipe)"
draft: false
category: "Data"
summary: "Cryptographic or multi-pass wipe with a certificate—so you can safely dispose of, sell, or repurpose hardware."
price: R250
featured: false
bullets:
  - Standards-based wipe (NIST-style or crypto-erase)
  - Per-device certificate with serial and date
  - SSD Secure Erase / sanitize where supported
  - E-waste guidance for safe recycling
faq:
  - q: "Is one pass enough?"
    a: "For modern drives, a proper Secure Erase or crypto-erase is enough. If you want multi-pass, we can do that on request."
  - q: "Can you wipe just part of a drive?"
    a: "We wipe the whole device for peace of mind. For targeted destruction, we suggest physical shredding of the old drive."
  - q: "Do you handle SSDs and HDDs?"
    a: "Yes. We choose the right method for each type. SSDs need controller-level erase; HDDs use overwrite methods."
  - q: "Will I get proof?"
    a: "Yes. You get a signed PDF certificate per device with model, serial, method, and date."
  - q: "Can you collect and recycle?"
    a: "We can help route e-waste legally. Ask us for options."

**TL;DR:** We wipe your drive the right way and give you a **Certificate of Data Destruction**.  
**Local:** Handy for SU students handing down laptops, homes in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** teams rotating machines.

### Problems we solve
- Old PCs going to a new owner and you don’t want your files found  
- Faulty disks you need to bin without risking data leaks  
- Company policy calls for proof of wipe with serials and dates  
- You want to repurpose a drive and start clean

### What’s included
- **Identify drive type** (HDD vs SSD/NVMe) and pick the right method  
- **Secure wipe** (crypto-erase, Secure Erase/sanitize, or multi-pass for HDD)  
- **Verification** that the wipe completed  
- **Signed certificate (PDF)** per device with model, serial, method, date, and operator  
- **Simple e-waste guidance** for safe, legal disposal

### How we do it (at a glance)
1) **Check the drive:** health, interface, encryption status  
2) **Pick method:** controller Secure Erase for SSDs, standards-based overwrite for HDDs, or crypto-erase if the drive was encrypted  
3) **Run wipe:** with logs where the tool supports it  
4) **Verify:** confirm completion and spot test  
5) **Certify:** generate and email the PDF certificate; we can print if you want  
6) **Recycle path:** we can route hardware to an approved recycler on request

Plain words, no jargon. You get clear proof.

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Labour:** **R250** per healthy drive (standard wipe)  
- **Extras:** Multi-pass HDD wipe or problem drives may cost more — we’ll confirm first  
- **Turnaround:** Often **same day**; very large HDDs can take longer

### Do-nots (protect your privacy)
- Don’t “quick format” and think it’s gone — it isn’t  
- Don’t sell or donate a PC with the old drive still inside  
- Don’t drill random holes and call it a day — data can still be read  
- Don’t toss batteries or drives in general trash — use e-waste routes

### When to stop DIY & call us
- Drive **clicks** or shows SMART errors (DIY wipes can fail)  
- The wipe tool throws **controller errors** on an SSD  
- You need **certificates** for audit or POPIA docs  
- The device holds work or customer data and you want no risk

### Real stories around town
- **SU post-grad:** Donating an old laptop. We crypto-erased the SSD and issued a cert. Happy handover, no stress.  
- **Die Boord family:** Old desktop with photos and tax files. We wiped the HDD, gave the cert, and routed the tower to e-waste.  
- **Technopark SME:** Quarterly refresh. We wiped a batch of drives with serial logs and filed the PDFs for audit.

### Simple care tips
- If you might need the data later, **image the drive first** — see [/services/data-backup-full-system-image/](/services/data-backup-full-system-image/)  
- Keep certs in a folder by **date** and **device name**  
- When in doubt, ask us if a drive should be **wiped** or **physically destroyed**

### Storage & recycling
We can wipe in the PC or via a dock. If the drive is failing, we’ll talk through options, including **physical destruction**. For e-waste, we use legal channels so parts don’t end up in the wrong place.

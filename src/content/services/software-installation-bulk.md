**TL;DR:** We install **4–8 apps** at once, sign you in, set clean defaults, and make sure each one opens and works.  
**Local:** Great for SU students, homes in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** teams rolling out new PCs.

### Problems we solve
- New PC with no tools yet  
- Old installs full of trials and pop-ups  
- Apps work on one PC but not the other  
- Licenses not activated, updates missing  
- Ten download pages and no time

### What’s included
- **Install 4–8 apps** from trusted sources  
- **License / account sign-in** and activation  
- **Updates on** with calm, safe channels  
- **Clean defaults** (privacy, file types, shortcuts)  
- **Quick test**: each app opens and does a simple task  
- **Short notes**: what we installed and where to find it

### How we do it (at a glance)
1) **Make the list:** you tell us the apps you need  
2) **Fetch safely:** download from the maker or known mirrors  
3) **Install cleanly:** no junk bundles, no toolbars  
4) **Sign in:** add your accounts/keys and check they stick  
5) **Set basics:** file associations, auto-start only when useful  
6) **Test:** quick open/save/print or login flow per app  
7) **Handover:** plain-English notes you can keep

Plain words. No tech talk.

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Bulk install fee:** **R300** (4–8 apps)  
- **More than eight apps?** We’ll quote before we start  
- **Turnaround:** Often **same day**; big downloads can add time  
- **Need it on-site?** Add [/services/on-site-surcharge-within-20km/](/services/on-site-surcharge-within-20km/)

### Good fits
- New laptop for class or work  
- Family PCs that need the same set of apps  
- Small offices standardising tools across a few machines

### Do-nots (save time and stress)
- Don’t click every “free add-on” during installs  
- Don’t mix five cleaners and “boosters”  
- Don’t use random key sites for licenses  
- Don’t let every app auto-start — it slows boot

### When to stop DIY & call us
- Apps won’t activate though you paid  
- Installers fail or roll back  
- File types open in the wrong app  
- Updates get stuck or break features

### Real stories around town
- **SU first-year (Huis Marais):** Needed Office, Zoom, a browser, and PDF tools. All set with a tidy start menu in one visit.  
- **Die Boord home office:** Two PCs; same eight apps. We matched defaults and set a weekly update window.  
- **Technopark team:** New laptops for hires. We loaded the stack, set sign-ins, and everyone was ready for Monday.

### Simple tips
- Keep your app list in a note so repeats are easy  
- Use one strong passphrase in a password manager  
- Let updates run on a quiet evening  
- Back up settings/export lists for key apps when possible

### What we’ll need
- **License keys** or account logins  
- Any **company installers** or portals  
- Your **Windows login** to complete installs

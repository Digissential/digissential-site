**TL;DR:** We make a slow PC feel quick again: clean start-up, remove junk, run updates, check health, and give you clear next steps.  
**Local:** Popular with SU students and homes in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, plus **Technopark** teams who want a smooth workday.

### Problems we fix
- Long **boot** times and apps that take ages to open  
- Fans spin up at idle; the PC feels busy doing nothing  
- Browser full of toolbars, pop-ups, and mystery add-ons  
- Disk nearly full; Windows nags for space  
- Updates fail or loop forever

### What’s included
- **Start-up clean-up:** trim heavy apps that launch at boot  
- **Updates:** Windows + common apps; drivers where helpful  
- **Disk health check:** SMART peek, free-space tidy, temp files cleared  
- **Browser hygiene:** remove shady add-ons; reset noisy settings  
- **Health notes:** simple report with what we did and easy tips

### How we do it (at a glance)
1) **Quick chat:** what’s slow and when it started  
2) **Start-up pass:** cut junk and set calmer defaults  
3) **Updates:** safe patches and key drivers  
4) **Health check:** disk SMART, RAM short test, event log glance  
5) **Browser clean:** remove pop-up junk; set a sane home page  
6) **Space tidy:** temp files and caches cleaned, recycle checked  
7) **Handover:** short notes + upgrade options if we spot limits

Plain words. No tech talk.

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Tune-up fee:** **R350** per PC  
- **Turnaround:** Often **same day** (queues and big updates can add time)  
- **If hardware looks weak:** we’ll suggest the best fix (e.g., SSD) before you decide

### Do-nots (save time and stress)
- Don’t stack three or four “PC boosters” — they fight and slow the PC  
- Don’t click every pop-up that offers a miracle clean  
- Don’t keep an HDD at 99% full — Windows crawls  
- Don’t ignore **SMART** warnings — that’s your early heads-up

### When to stop DIY & call us
- The PC still crawls after your own clean-up  
- Updates fail again and again  
- You see **“disk 100%”** in Task Manager a lot  
- Blue screens or random restarts pop up during normal use  
- Drive clicks or the case feels hot at idle

### Real stories around town
- **SU first-year (Huis Marais):** Laptop took 7 minutes to boot. We trimmed start-up apps, cleared pop-ups, and it opened in under a minute.  
- **Die Boord family PC:** HDD at 98% full and noisy. We freed space, set a basic backup, and priced an SSD that made it feel new.  
- **Technopark sales laptop:** Browser hijacked, tabs crashing. We removed bad add-ons, updated, and set calm defaults. Smooth again.

### Simple tips
- Let Windows update on a quiet evening once a week  
- Keep at least **20%** free space on the system drive  
- Use one good password manager; trim auto-start apps you don’t use  
- Dust the front mesh now and then; heat makes PCs sluggish

### What we’ll need
- Your **Windows login** and, if prompted, admin rights  
- Any **BitLocker** key if Windows asks after updates  
- A note on when it’s slow (start-up, after sleep, on Wi-Fi, in a browser)

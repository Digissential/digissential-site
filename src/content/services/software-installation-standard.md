**TL;DR:** We install **up to 3 apps**, sign you in, flip on updates, and do a quick test so they just work.  
**Local:** Handy for SU students, homes in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** teams.

### Problems we solve
- New app won’t install or keeps failing  
- Trial junk everywhere after a download  
- App won’t activate though you paid  
- Files open in the wrong program  
- Pop-ups and toolbars after a “free” installer

### What’s included
- Install **up to three apps** from trusted sources  
- **License/account** activation where needed  
- **Updates on** with calm settings  
- **Clean defaults** (privacy, file types, shortcuts)  
- **Quick test** so each app opens and does a simple task  
- Short notes of what we added

### Common picks
Microsoft Office, Zoom/Teams, Adobe Reader, VLC, 7-Zip, Chrome/Brave/Firefox, note apps, PDF tools, photo viewers.

### How we do it (at a glance)
1) **Make the list:** tell us your 1–3 apps  
2) **Fetch safely:** from the maker or a known mirror  
3) **Install clean:** no junk bundles, no toolbars  
4) **Sign in/activate** if the app needs it  
5) **Set basics:** file types, start menu, calm start-up  
6) **Test:** open/save/print or a quick login

Plain words. No tech talk.

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Standard install:** **R180** for up to **3 apps**  
- **Need more?** See [/services/software-installation-bulk/](/services/software-installation-bulk/) for **4–8 apps**  
- **Turnaround:** Often **same day**; big downloads can add time  
- **On-site option:** Add [/services/on-site-surcharge-within-20km/](/services/on-site-surcharge-within-20km/)

### Do-nots (save time and stress)
- Don’t grab apps from random “free” sites  
- Don’t click every extra add-on in installers  
- Don’t mix five “cleaners/boosters”  
- Don’t let every app auto-start

### When to stop DIY & call us
- Installer rolls back with odd errors  
- App says “not licensed” after you paid  
- PDFs, photos, or docs open in the wrong thing  
- Updates fail or break features

### Real stories around town
- **SU first-year (Huis Marais):** Needed Office, Zoom, and a PDF app. We installed, signed in, and set calm updates—done in one visit.  
- **Die Boord home office:** Two machines. We added three apps on both, matched defaults, and set a weekly update time.  
- **Technopark hire:** New laptop, three key tools. We installed, activated, and put the right shortcuts on the taskbar. Ready for Monday.

### Simple tips
- Keep your app list and keys in a password manager  
- Let updates run on a quiet evening  
- Pin daily apps to the taskbar; unpin the rest  
- Export settings when your app allows it

### What we’ll need
- **License keys** or account logins (if required)  
- Any **company installers** or portal links  
- Your **Windows login** to finish installs

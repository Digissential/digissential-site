**TL;DR:** Fresh Windows, correct drivers, updates, and a short burn-in so the PC is stable and quiet.  
**Local:** Popular with SU students, families in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** teams after a new build or big upgrade.

### Problems we solve
- “New build boots but feels buggy or slow”  
- Games crash after driver installs  
- High temps or loud fans on day one  
- Windows nags and random bloat on a fresh PC  
- Not sure if the setup is really stable

### What’s included
- **Clean OS install** and activation (with your key/account)  
- **Driver stack** from the right vendors (chipset → GPU → LAN/Wi-Fi → audio and the rest)  
- **Windows updates** and calm start-up (no junk, no random “optimizers”)  
- **Burn-in/stability check** with temps and a quick fan curve sanity pass  
- **Restore point** and simple handover notes you can keep

### How we do it (at a glance)
1) **Prep:** confirm parts, BIOS version, storage layout  
2) **Install:** clean Windows, set region, add your account  
3) **Drivers:** load maker drivers in a safe order  
4) **Update & tidy:** apply updates, trim start-up, set clean defaults  
5) **Burn-in:** short CPU/GPU load, watch temps, clocks, and noise  
6) **Handover:** restore point, driver list, and easy tips

Plain words. No jargon.

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Add-on fee:** **R300** (when combined with assembly or major upgrades)  
- **Turnaround:** Often **same day**  
- **Helpful pairings:**  
  - We build it too: [/services/pc-assembly-full-build/](/services/pc-assembly-full-build/)  
  - Move your files: [/services/data-migration/](/services/data-migration/)  
  - Firmware help: [/services/firmware-bios-uefi-updates/](/services/firmware-bios-uefi-updates/)

### Do-nots (save time and parts)
- Don’t install five driver “updaters” — they fight and break things  
- Don’t skip chipset drivers — they make everything else behave  
- Don’t game on carpet or a blanket during first tests — temps lie  
- Don’t force a BIOS flash without checking the exact model

### When to stop DIY & call us
- Blue screens or game crashes on a brand-new build  
- Fans spike with light work or the case feels hot at idle  
- Windows activation fails or loops  
- GPU drivers won’t install cleanly

### Real stories around town
- **SU first-year (Huis Marais):** New PC stuttered in Valorant. Clean OS, proper drivers, and a short burn-in fixed it.  
- **Die Boord family desktop:** Loud from first boot. We set sane fan curves and temps dropped; noise calmed.  
- **Technopark dev box:** Fresh build crashed on sleep. Driver order and a firmware nudge made it stable.

### Simple tips
- Keep the case off carpet; clear the front mesh  
- Let Windows update on a quiet night each week  
- Keep one strong passphrase in a password manager  
- Do a small backup after big changes — see [/services/data-backup-full-system-image/](/services/data-backup-full-system-image/)

### Great to pair with
- [/services/pc-assembly-full-build/](/services/pc-assembly-full-build/)  
- [/services/ssd-upgrade-bundle-clone-swap/](/services/ssd-upgrade-bundle-clone-swap/) *(or ask us to clone your old drive during the build)*  
- [/services/driver-installation/](/services/driver-installation/) and [/services/speed-up-tune-up/](/services/speed-up-tune-up/)

### What we’ll need
- Your **Windows key** or Microsoft account (if needed)  
- Any **paid app installers/keys** you want added  
- The **PC and power cable** (and Wi-Fi password if not wired)

### Handy links
- **We assemble too:** [/services/pc-assembly-full-build/](/services/pc-assembly-full-build/)  
- **Move your files:** [/services/data-migration/](/services/data-migration/)  
- **Drivers done right:** [/services/driver-installation/](/services/driver-installation/)

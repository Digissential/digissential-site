**TL;DR:** Pay once to jump the queue so we start your job sooner.  
**Local:** Handy for SU deadlines, home offices in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** teams where every hour matters.

### When to use it
- You have an exam, flight, or live event today or tomorrow  
- A shop till, office PC, or laptop must get looked at fast  
- You need a clear answer and path without waiting in line

### How it works (at a glance)
1) **Book + drop-off / remote check-in**  
2) We **start next business day** (often sooner if you arrive early)  
3) **Status updates** as we test, quote, and—if you approve—repair  
4) If parts are needed, we **order right away** and prep what we can

This is an **add-on fee**. Normal labour, parts, and call-outs still apply.

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Expedite add-on:** **R500** per device  
- **Start time:** Moved ahead of the standard queue, usually **next business day**  
- **Notes:** Parts lead-times and supplier stock can affect completion

### What it covers
- Priority **start** on the bench or remote session  
- Faster **diagnostic** and quote so you can decide  
- **Updates** at key steps (found fault, parts ETA, ready for pick-up)

### Not included
- After-hours or weekend work (quoted separately)  
- Any promise of same-day **completion**  
- Supplier lead-times (we’ll share real ETAs)

### Do-nots (save money and stress)
- Don’t add this if the device clearly needs rare parts we can’t get fast  
- Don’t skip the **diagnostic**—we need facts before we can fix  
- Don’t plan travel around a same-day finish unless we confirm first

### Real stories around town
- **SU student (Huis Marais):** Laptop died before a submission. We expedited, found a bad SSD cable, fixed it, and he submitted that night.  
- **Die Boord home office:** Printer blocked payroll day. We prioritised remote setup and had payslips out in 30 minutes.  
- **Technopark front desk:** POS stuck on updates. We expedited, rolled back, and set a quiet update window.

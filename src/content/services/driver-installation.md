summary: "Install or repair device drivers for stable performance—graphics, chipset, audio, Wi-Fi, printers and more."
price: R180

bullets:
  - Identify missing or outdated drivers
  - Install vendor-approved versions only
  - Verify devices work (sound, Wi-Fi, GPU, printer)
  - Create a restore point and roll-back plan
faq:
  - q: "Will you use DriverPack tools?"
    a: "No. We download from the maker (Dell/HP/Lenovo/NVIDIA/AMD/Intel/etc.) to avoid junk and weird bugs."
  - q: "Can you fix unknown devices?"
    a: "Usually yes. We match hardware IDs to the right driver."
  - q: "Do you handle printers and scanners?"
    a: "Yes. We install the correct package and test a page or scan."
  - q: "My games crash after a GPU update. Can you help?"
    a: "Yes. We do a clean install of the graphics driver and test."
  - q: "How long does it take?"
    a: "Often same day. Big GPU or chipset packages can add time."
  - q: "Do you keep vendor updaters?"
    a: "Only if they’re helpful. If they nag or add bloat, we disable them."

**TL;DR:** We find the right drivers, install them cleanly, test the hardware, and set a restore point.  
**Local:** Popular with SU students, homes in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** teams when sound, Wi-Fi, or printers act up.

### Problems we fix
- Yellow warning icons in **Device Manager**  
- No sound, no Wi-Fi/Bluetooth, or webcam missing  
- Touchpad gestures gone after an update  
- Games stutter or crash after a GPU change  
- Printer shows “driver unavailable” or won’t print  
- “Unknown device” with a long hardware ID

### How we do it (at a glance)
1) **Check the model** and read hardware IDs  
2) **Download from the maker** (OEM/OEM component) — no third-party packs  
3) **Install cleanly**: chipset first, then GPU, audio, LAN/Wi-Fi, and the rest  
4) **Test**: sound out, mic in, Wi-Fi speed, printer page, webcam, sleep/wake  
5) **Safety step**: make a restore point and note driver versions

Plain words. Clear steps. No random “optimizers.”

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Labour:** **R180** per PC for standard driver work  
- **Extras:** Large GPU/chipset bundles or firmware flashes can add time; we’ll confirm first  
- **Turnaround:** Often **same day**; on-site adds a small call-out if needed

### Do-nots (save time and stress)
- Don’t run multiple **driver updaters** — they fight and break things  
- Don’t pull drivers from shady sites  
- Don’t force a BIOS/EC flash just to “fix” a minor issue  
- Don’t unplug during a firmware update

### When to stop DIY & call us
- Blue screens right after a driver install  
- No network after Windows reinstall (no way to fetch drivers)  
- Printer install loop or scanner won’t show up  
- Docking station video/USB doesn’t work right

### Real stories around town
- **SU first-year (Huis Marais):** No Wi-Fi after a Windows update. We installed the right Intel driver and the card came back in minutes.  
- **Welgevonden home office:** “Printer unavailable” all week. We cleared old queues, loaded the correct package, and printed a test page.  
- **Technopark laptop** on a dock: external screens dark. We updated GPU and dock firmware, then all three screens lit up.

### Simple tips
- Keep Windows Update on, but pause big driver pushes before exams or deadlines  
- Save your **model/SN** in a note for faster help  
- If a driver works well, you don’t have to chase every update  
- Make a **restore point** before major changes (we’ll show you how)

### What we’ll need
- Your **device and charger**  
- The **exact model** or a photo of the service tag  
- For printers/scanners: the **model** and how it connects (USB/Wi-Fi)

**TL;DR:** Pop-ups, toolbars, weird redirects? We remove the junk, repair the damage, run updates, and set simple protections.  
**Local:** Common for SU students in **Idas Valley**, homes in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** teams after a bad link or shady download.

### Problems we fix
- Pop-ups, fake “Your PC is infected!” warnings  
- Browser home page changed; search full of ads  
- Start-up is slow; mystery apps add themselves back  
- CPU or disk sits high at idle  
- Links in mail open dodgy sites

### What’s included
- **Reputable scans** plus manual checks (no scareware)  
- **Start-up clean** and scheduled task tidy  
- **Browser reset** only if needed; keep your bookmarks where we can  
- **Windows and app updates** to a safe baseline  
- **Plain tips** so it stays clean

### How we do it (at a glance)
1) **Quick check:** symptoms, recent clicks, and a fast health peek  
2) **Contain:** kill bad tasks, disable risky items, set a restore point  
3) **Clean:** trusted scanners + manual sweep (folders, tasks, services)  
4) **Fix the browser:** remove junk add-ons; reset only if needed  
5) **Patch:** Windows and common apps; tidy drivers if useful  
6) **Handover:** short notes and simple safety habits

Plain words. No tech talk.

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Fee:** **R550** per PC  
- **Turnaround:** Often **same day**; heavy cases can take longer  
- **If damage is deep:** we’ll talk about a clean rebuild or backup first (your choice)

### Do-nots (to protect your data)
- Don’t pay ransoms or call “support” numbers in pop-ups  
- Don’t install random “cleaners/boosters” from ads  
- Don’t run two antivirus apps at once — they fight  
- Don’t log into banking on a PC you think is infected  
- Don’t ignore **SMART** warnings or strange drive noise

### When to stop DIY & call us
- Files got renamed or show odd extensions (possible ransomware)  
- Pop-ups come back right after you “remove” them  
- Browser keeps redirecting even in another profile  
- Updates fail again and again  
- The PC is too slow to use while you try to fix it

### Real stories around town
- **SU first-year (Huis Marais):** Clicked a fake “update.” We cleaned start-up, reset one browser, and patched apps. Back to class the same day.  
- **Die Boord family PC:** Toolbars everywhere. We removed junk suites, tidied tasks, set Defender right, and things felt normal again.  
- **Technopark laptop:** Pop-ups after a “free PDF tool.” Cleaned, set safe defaults, and added a calm update plan.

### Simple tips
- Keep one good antivirus (Defender is fine when set right)  
- Update Windows and apps on a quiet night each week  
- Only add browser extensions you trust  
- Use a password manager and turn on 2-step sign-in  
- Keep a small backup — cloud or image — so rollbacks are easy

### What we’ll need
- Your **Windows login** (you type it)  
- The **PC and charger** (for laptops)  
- Any links or apps you clicked before the problem started

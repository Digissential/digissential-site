**TL;DR:** We test your PC on the bench, tell you what’s wrong, and give a clear written plan with price.  
**Local:** Helpful for SU students, homes in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** teams who need answers today.

### Symptoms we check
- Blue screens, boot loops, or “no bootable device”  
- Random restarts or freezes  
- Very slow start-up or apps that hang  
- No display, beeps on start, or fans maxing out  
- “Disk SMART” warnings, clicking drives, or hot cases  
- Updates stuck or Windows won’t load after an update

### How we do it (at a glance)
1) **Intake & notes:** what changed, when it started, and any noises/smells  
2) **Power & POST:** basic power tests, quick visual inside (if needed)  
3) **Storage & memory:** SMART read and short **RAM** test  
4) **Windows health:** quick event and start-up review (plain words)  
5) **Findings & options:** simple write-up with price (repair / upgrade / data-first)

If a long RAM test, full surface scan, or thermal soak is needed, we’ll suggest **Hardware Diagnostics (Extended)** and explain why.

  <p class="m-0 text-white/80 text-sm"><strong>Tip:</strong> Intermittent restarts or heat issues often need longer, load-based testing. See <a class="link-fancy" href="/services/hardware-diagnostics-extended/">Hardware Diagnostics (Extended)</a>.</p>

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Diagnostic fee:** **R150**  
- **Turnaround:** Often **same day**, based on queue and updates  
- **Credit:** We may credit the fee if you approve a repair right away

### Do-nots (to save data and parts)
- Don’t keep powering a **clicking** drive  
- Don’t force shutdowns during “Working on updates” unless we tell you to  
- Don’t run three “driver updater” tools — they cause weird faults  
- Don’t keep using a laptop with a **swollen** battery or a **burnt** smell

### When to stop DIY & call us
- Beeps on start, no display, or sudden power-offs  
- Repeated blue screens after login  
- Liquid spill or coffee in the keyboard  
- Windows asks to **format** a drive that has important files

### Real stories around town
- **SU first-year (Huis Marais):** Laptop froze during an upload. Bad RAM stick. We swapped it and he submitted the same afternoon.  
- **Die Boord home PC:** Slow and loud. Dust-clogged cooler and a dying HDD. We cleaned it, moved to SSD, and it booted fast again.  
- **Technopark front desk:** POS stuck on updates at 7:30 am. We rolled back, set a calmer update window, and doors opened on time.

### What to bring
- The device and **charger/power lead**  
- **Passwords** we might need (Windows login, BitLocker key if shown)  
- A short note on when it started and what changed (new app, drop, spill)

### After the diagnosis
You get a **clear written estimate** with options. You choose: repair, upgrade, or data-first. No pressure, no hidden costs. If you go ahead, the diagnostic fee **may be credited** at our discretion.

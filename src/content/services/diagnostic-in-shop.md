  <p class="m-0 text-white/80 text-sm"><strong>Tip:</strong> If symptoms are intermittent, only appear under load, or you suspect a hardware fault we can’t reproduce quickly, we may recommend <a class="link-fancy" href="/services/hardware-diagnostics-extended">Hardware Diagnostics (Extended)</a> for deeper testing.</p>
</div>

### Good signs you need this
- Blue screens, no-boot, or random restarts  
- Device is unusually slow or freezes  
- You suspect a hardware issue but aren’t sure which part is failing

### Turnaround

Most basic diagnostics are **same day**. Timing depends on queue, updates, and whether symptoms appear during testing.

### What to bring

- Your device and charger/power lead  
- Any relevant passwords (e.g., Windows login)  
- A short description of the issue and when it started

### After the diagnosis

We’ll explain the findings and give you **transparent options** (repair, upgrade, or data-first). You choose the path forward—**no pressure and no hidden costs**. If you approve a repair, the diagnostic fee **may be credited** at our discretion.

draft: false
category: "Data"
summary: "Bit-for-bit image of your Windows drive, so you can restore everything — apps, settings, and files."
price: R650
featured: false
bullets:
  - Full-disk image (OS, apps, data, boot info)
  - Integrity check after imaging
  - Clear labels and simple restore notes
  - Best before risky changes or big upgrades
faq:
  - q: "Can I restore this image myself?"
    a: "Yes. We give plain steps and a boot tool. If you want us to do it, we can quote for the restore."
  - q: "How big is the image?"
    a: "Close to the used space on your drive (often smaller with compression). We estimate before we start."
  - q: "Does it include hidden recovery partitions?"
    a: "Yes. A full image copies the boot and recovery bits too, so the system comes back as it was."
  - q: "What if my drive is encrypted (BitLocker)?"
    a: "We can image it. We’ll ask for your key so restore is smooth later."
  - q: "Can I restore to different hardware?"
    a: "Sometimes yes, but drivers can be tricky. For a move to a new PC we suggest [/services/data-migration/](/services/data-migration/) plus a fresh Windows install."

**TL;DR:** We make a full, bit-for-bit copy of your Windows drive and check it works. If the worst happens, you can roll back fast.  
**Local:** Great for SU students before exams, homes in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** teams before major updates.

### Problems we solve
- You need a safety net before a risky change  
- A work PC can’t be down if an update breaks things  
- You want an exact “known-good” snapshot  
- You’re moving to a bigger drive and want a clean fallback  
- You worry about ransomware and want a safe image offline

### What’s included
- **Sector-level image** of your Windows system drive (OS, apps, settings, data, boot and recovery)  
- **Integrity verification** so we know the image is good  
- **Clear labels** on the storage with the date and machine name  
- **Simple restore guide** (plain English, step by step)

### How we do it (at a glance)
1) **Quick check:** drive health, space needed, and power setup  
2) **Image:** bit-for-bit copy to your USB SSD/HDD (we can supply one)  
3) **Verify:** run an integrity check and spot-open files from a mount  
4) **Label:** name, date, and short paper/ PDF notes for restore  
5) **Store smart:** we suggest where to keep it so it stays safe

No jargon. We show you the exact steps to get back on your feet.

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Labour:** **R650** for one system drive image  
- **Storage:** Bring a USB SSD/HDD with free space ≥ your used space. We can supply storage on request.  
- **Turnaround:** Often **same day** (size-dependent). Very large drives take longer to copy.

### When this service is ideal
- Before a **Windows reinstall** or big feature update  
- **Mission-critical** machines (POS, accounting, thesis PCs)  
- **Drive upgrade** to a larger SSD where you want a fallback  
- **Travel** or loaner periods where loss/theft risk is higher

### Do-nots (to protect your image)
- Don’t save the image on the **same PC** only — keep a copy off the machine  
- Don’t keep the only image **plugged in** all the time — unplug when done  
- Don’t delete your **BitLocker key** — store it in your account or print it  
- Don’t keep using a drive that **clicks** or throws read errors — call us first

### When to stop DIY & call us
- Imaging stalls or throws read errors  
- The source drive makes new noises (click/beep/whine)  
- You’re not sure how to make a **boot USB** for restore  
- Windows won’t start and you need files **now**

### Real stories around town
- **SU student (Huis Marais):** Took a system image before a driver update. The update broke audio; we rolled back in one go and sound returned.  
- **Die Boord small office:** We imaged the bookkeeper’s PC before year-end updates. When an app patch failed, we restored and they kept working.  
- **Technopark CAD team:** Moved to larger NVMe drives. We made images first, then cloned to the new drives with zero project loss.

### Simple care tips
- Keep **two** copies: one near you, one off-site or in cloud storage  
- Refresh the image after big milestones (major updates or app installs)  
- Label by **date** and **PC name** so you can grab the right one fast  
- Pair with [/services/cloud-backup-setup/](/services/cloud-backup-setup/) for daily file-level safety

### Storage
Bring a USB SSD/HDD with free space **at least as large** as the used space on your system drive. Not sure how big that is? We’ll check and advise. We can also supply storage if you need it.

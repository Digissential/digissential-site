faq:
  - q: "Can you also install Windows and drivers?"
    a: "Yes — add [/services/os-burn-in-add-on/](/services/os-burn-in-add-on/) for a clean install, drivers, updates, and a short burn-in."
  - q: "What if a part is DOA?"
    a: "We help isolate the fault and guide the return. If we sourced it, we handle the RMA chat for you."
  - q: "Do you build Small Form Factor (SFF)?"
    a: "Yes. SFF needs careful airflow and cable planning. We map it so temps and noise stay sane."
  - q: "Will my RGB and fans sync?"
    a: "We hook up headers, set tidy fan curves, and leave simple notes so you can tweak later."
  - q: "Do you enable XMP/EXPO?"
    a: "Yes when the kit and board support it. If unstable, we’ll set a safe speed and tell you why."

**TL;DR:** We build your PC the right way — tidy cables, fresh paste, smart BIOS settings, and a calm, quiet first boot.  
**Local:** Popular with SU students, families in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** teams who want a solid machine without stress.

### Problems we solve
- “Parts are here… I’m scared to break something.”  
- Messy cables, hot temps, loud fans  
- RAM won’t run at rated speed  
- No display on first boot; mystery beeps  
- RGB chaos and fans that won’t behave

### What’s included
- **Careful assembly** with anti-static handling and clean cable routing  
- **Fresh thermal paste** and correct cooler mounting  
- **Firmware/BIOS check**, set date/time, SATA/NVMe modes, TPM/secure boot as needed  
- **Memory profile** (XMP/EXPO) where stable  
- **Short stability + thermals validation** and a quick **noise pass**  
- **Handover notes** in plain words (fan curves, headers used, next steps)

### How we build (at a glance)
1) **Pre-check:** parts list sanity (CPU/board/RAM/PSU fit, case airflow)  
2) **Board out:** CPU in, paste and cooler fitted, RAM and NVMe seated  
3) **In the case:** standoffs right, neat cables, no trapped wires in fans  
4) **Power-up:** POST first try where possible, tidy BIOS settings  
5) **Validate:** quick load test, temps and fan curve sanity  
6) **Handover:** simple notes; if you add OS later, see [/services/os-burn-in-add-on/](/services/os-burn-in-add-on/)

Plain words. No geek speak.

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Assembly fee:** **R1 200** per full build  
- **Turnaround:** Typically **1–2 days** after parts arrive (queue dependent)  
- **Optional add-on:** [/services/os-burn-in-add-on/](/services/os-burn-in-add-on/) — **R300** for clean Windows, drivers, updates, and a burn-in  
- **Parts sourcing:** We can quote local stock at store prices if you prefer

### Do-nots (save parts and cash)
- Don’t mix **modular PSU cables** across brands — they can fry hardware  
- Don’t run a CPU **without** the cooler “just to test”  
- Don’t overtighten cooler or motherboard screws — standoffs strip  
- Don’t force front-panel pins; a photo before removal helps later  
- Don’t stick all fans as intake — balance matters

### When to stop DIY & call us
- No display or repeating beeps on first boot  
- Fans surge, temps spike at idle, or it smells hot  
- RAM won’t run rated speed and games crash  
- USB, front audio, or power button acts odd after your attempt

### Real stories around town
- **SU first-year (Huis Marais):** New gaming build wouldn’t POST. One RAM stick half-seated. We fixed, set XMP, and it ran cool and quiet.  
- **Die Boord family PC:** Wanted quiet for photo edits. Mesh case, slow fan curve, tidy cables — whisper silent.  
- **Technopark dev box:** Needed lots of NVMe storage and stable temps. We planned airflow, spaced drives, and set calm curves. Rock solid.

### Simple care tips
- Keep the case off carpet; dust the front mesh now and then  
- Use one strong passphrase and let Windows update on a quiet night  
- Back up key files weekly — start with [/services/cloud-backup-setup/](/services/cloud-backup-setup/)  
- Label spare PSU cables; don’t mix with other brands

### Optional Add-On
Pair with [/services/os-burn-in-add-on/](/services/os-burn-in-add-on/) for a **ready-to-use** handover: clean Windows, proper drivers, updates, a short burn-in, restore point, and simple notes.

### What to bring
- All **parts**, case screws, and **PSU cables** that came in the box  
- Your **Windows key** or Microsoft account (if adding the OS add-on)  
- Any extra fans or RGB gear you want installed  
- Your **Wi-Fi password** if we’re setting up the OS

### Notes on parts & warranty
If a part is **DOA**, we help isolate the fault and guide the return. Parts you supply keep their maker/retail warranty. Our labour covers workmanship on the build.

**TL;DR:** We set up a safe remote app so next time you need help, we can connect fast and fix things without a call-out.  
**Local:** Great for SU students, homes in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** teams who want quick help.

### What’s included
- Install and configure a **secure remote tool**  
- Show you how to **start and approve** a session  
- Do a **test connect** and short sign-off so you’re comfy  
- Plain notes on how to launch it next time

### Why set this up
When stuff breaks, you don’t want paperwork and downloads. You want help now. With this in place, we can connect in a minute, fix the issue, and you get on with your day.

### How we do it (at a glance)
1) **Quick call or visit:** we download the app together  
2) **Set safe options:** consent needed each time; no auto logins  
3) **Test connect:** you watch our pointer move; you can stop any time  
4) **Walk-through:** where to click next time; tiny cheat-sheet  
5) **Done:** you keep control; the tool sits quietly until you say “go”

Plain words. No tech talk.

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Setup fee:** **R150** (once-off, per PC)  
- **Length:** **10–15 minutes**  
- **Need help right now?** Book a [/services/remote-support-setup/](/services/remote-support-setup/) *(setup)* then start a [/services/remote-support-setup/](/services/remote-support-setup/) or go straight to a [/services/remote-support-setup/](/services/remote-support-setup/) session if you’re already set up  
- **Hourly remote work:** see [/services/remote-support-setup/](/services/remote-support-setup/) *(Remote Support Session at R350/hr)*

### Do-nots (save time and stress)
- Don’t share passwords by SMS or email—type them yourself when asked  
- Don’t install random “remote helper” from ads  
- Don’t close the laptop mid-session; let us sign off first  
- Don’t use guest Wi-Fi for the PC—we may not reach it there

### When to book a full **Remote Support Session**
- Email won’t add or keeps asking for a password  
- Printer says “driver unavailable”  
- Start-up is slow and pop-ups won’t quit  
- Updates fail again and again

### Real stories around town
- **SU first-year (Huis Marais):** We set the tool in 10 minutes. A week later mail broke; we fixed it in a quick remote slot before class.  
- **Die Boord home office:** Dad’s PC kept asking for scan drivers. Remote setup meant we jumped on, fixed it, and saved a trip.  
- **Technopark admin:** Printer queues stuck monthly. With remote ready, we cleared and reset things in one short call.

### Simple tips
- Keep the app icon on the desktop so it’s easy to find  
- Leave the **router and PC** on during remote work  
- Keep a small UPS on router + main node to ride out load-shedding  
- Save our contact in your phone so you can book fast

### What we’ll need
- A **stable internet** link  
- Your **Windows/macOS login** handy for prompts  
- Your **phone** for 2-step approvals (if used)

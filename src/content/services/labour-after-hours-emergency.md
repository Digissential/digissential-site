**TL;DR:** Need help **after 17:30**, on a **weekend**, or a **public holiday**? We jump on it fast. Remote if we can, on-site if we must.

**Local:** Common for SU students on deadlines, families in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** teams when a till or laptop fails after hours.

### When to use it
- **Exam or submission** tonight and the laptop won’t start  
- **POS or office PC** stuck on updates before trade  
- **Travel tomorrow** and you need a working machine  
- **Email or Wi-Fi** down during an event or booking rush

### How it works (at a glance)
1) **Quick contact:** Call/WhatsApp or [/contact/](/contact/)  
2) **Triage:** We try a fast remote session first  
3) **If needed:** Arrange on-site or drop-off  
4) **Update:** You get clear progress and choices (repair, workaround, or next step)

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **After-hours labour:** **R650/hr**, billed in **30-minute** blocks  
- **Scope:** Weeknights after **17:30**, **weekends**, and **public holidays**  
- **On-site:** Standard call-out may apply; we’ll confirm first  
- **Notes:** Parts and supplier stock can affect finish time

### What’s included
- **Priority start** outside normal hours  
- **Remote or on-site** help where it makes sense  
- **Plain updates** at key steps (found fault, quote, ready)

### Do-nots (save time and stress)
- Don’t keep forcing updates or hard power-offs over and over  
- Don’t run random “fixer” tools from ads  
- Don’t open a clicking drive—power down and call  
- Don’t ignore a **swollen battery** or **burnt** smell

### When to stop DIY & call us
- Blue screens right before a deadline  
- POS won’t pass the update screen  
- Wi-Fi or email down and you need it now  
- BitLocker or passwords blocking you after changes

### Real stories around town
- **SU first-year (Huis Marais):** Locked out before a Moodle upload. We did a remote profile fix and he submitted on time.  
- **Die Boord home office:** Printer jammed on payroll night. We cleared the queue, re-added the driver, and payslips went out.  
- **Technopark front desk:** PC stuck on updates Sunday evening. We rolled back and set a calm update window.

### What we’ll need
- Your **device and charger** (if we come out)  
- A phone line for quick updates  
- **Passwords/keys** if Windows asks (BitLocker/admin)  
- Stable internet if we work remote

### Handy links

**TL;DR:** A quick remote check every **3 months** keeps your PC smooth and safe: updates, SMART peek, start-up tidy, browser clean, and a backup check.  
**Local:** Great for SU students, families in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** teams who want fewer surprises.

### Problems we prevent
- Slow start-up and random pop-ups  
- Old apps with known holes  
- Drives that fail with no warning  
- Browser bloat that changes your home page  
- Backups that quietly stopped months ago

### What’s included
- **Updates review:** Windows and common apps  
- **SMART quick-look:** early signs on HDDs/SSDs  
- **Start-up audit:** cut junk that drags boot time  
- **Browser hygiene:** remove shady add-ons, set calm defaults  
- **Backup check:** see if it’s working and suggest a simple fix if not  
- **Short notes:** what we changed and easy next steps

### How we do it (at a glance)
1) **Connect securely** with your OK (you can watch)  
2) **Check updates** and queue safe ones  
3) **Peek at SMART:** look for warnings and temps  
4) **Tidy start-up** and clean risky browser items  
5) **Check backup:** cloud/app status and last run  
6) **Handover:** plain-English notes you can keep

Plain words. No tech talk.

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **R350 per device** per session (remote)  
- **Length:** about **30–45 minutes** for a normal pass  
- **Cadence:** every **3 months** is smart; ad-hoc is fine too  
- **Need on-site?** Add [/services/on-site-surcharge-within-20km/](/services/on-site-surcharge-within-20km/)

### Do-nots (save time and stress)
- Don’t run three “PC cleaners” — they fight each other  
- Don’t ignore SMART warnings — that’s your early clue  
- Don’t put your only backup on the same desk, always plugged in  
- Don’t leave 20 toolbars in the browser — speed dies fast

### When to stop DIY & call us
- You hear **clicks** or see SMART “Bad”  
- Updates fail every time or roll back  
- Browser keeps opening to ads you didn’t set  
- Backups show errors or haven’t run for weeks

### Real stories around town
- **SU first-year (Huis Marais):** Slow boot and pop-ups. We trimmed start-up, cleaned the browser, and set a weekly update slot. Much faster.  
- **Die Boord family PC:** Old HDD showed rising reallocated sectors. We flagged it early and moved to SSD before it died.  
- **Technopark laptop fleet:** Quarterly checks caught a backup agent that stopped after a password change. Fixed before year-end rush.

### Simple care tips
- Let Windows update on a quiet night once a week  
- Keep one strong passphrase in a password manager  
- Do a tiny file backup after big school/work milestones  
- Keep the laptop off blankets; heat shortens drive life

### What we’ll need
- A **stable internet** link and a quick time window  
- Your OK to connect, plus any admin password if prompts show  
- If you use 2-step login, have your **phone** handy

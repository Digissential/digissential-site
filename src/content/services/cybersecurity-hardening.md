**TL;DR:** We update your PC, tighten the weak spots, and set simple rules that keep you safe without nagging.  
**Local:** Great for SU students, homes in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** teams who want fewer pop-ups and safer clicks.

### Problems we fix
- Old Windows and apps with known holes  
- Browser pop-ups and fake “update” ads  
- “Defender off” or “SmartScreen disabled”  
- Random toolbars and risky startup junk  
- Endless nags because settings fight each other

### How we do it (at a glance)
1) **Update** Windows, drivers, Office, and common apps  
2) **Harden** the browser (safe defaults, anti-phishing, sane extensions)  
3) **Tune Defender** and SmartScreen for real-world use  
4) **Clean startup/services** that slow and expose the PC  
5) **Set firewall and UAC** to good, quiet defaults  
6) **Privacy tweaks** to reduce tracking where it helps  
7) **Quick test:** safe sites load, apps work, no odd prompts

You get plain notes of what changed and a short “how to stay safe” page.

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Labour:** **R450** per PC  
- **Turnaround:** Often **same day** (30–60 minutes in-shop or on-site, update time may vary)  
- **Remote option:** Light hardening can be done over [/services/remote-support-setup/](/services/remote-support-setup/)

### Do-nots (protect your files and cash)
- Don’t click “your PC is infected” banners — close the tab  
- Don’t run three antiviruses at once — they fight and slow down  
- Don’t install “free cleaners” from ads — many are junk or worse  
- Don’t keep using an admin account for daily work — we can set a safer user

### When to stop DIY & call us
- Browser opens to ads you never set  
- Bank site looks odd or asks for extra codes  
- Files end in weird extensions or won’t open  
- Defender is off and won’t stay on  
- You installed a “codec/update” and now the PC is strange

### Real stories around town
- **SU first-year (Huis Marais):** Kept seeing fake “update Chrome” pop-ups. We hardened the browser, set Defender rules, and the noise stopped.  
- **Die Boord family PC:** Kids’ games added toolbars and push ads. We cleaned the junk, set a standard user for kids, and calm returned.  
- **Technopark SME:** Staff hit a phishing test. We tuned mail and browser filters, set 2FA tips, and shared a one-page guide. No repeats since.

### Simple care tips
- Use a password manager with one strong phrase  
- Turn on 2-step login for email and banking  
- Let Windows update on a quiet night each week  
- Back up to cloud or a drive that stays unplugged when not in use — see [/services/cloud-backup-setup/](/services/cloud-backup-setup/)  
- If a download asks to “allow unknown publisher,” stop and ask us

### What you’ll get
- Safer defaults and fresh patches  
- Clean start-up and fewer nags  
- A short, friendly guide to avoid common traps  
- Clear next steps if your setup needs more (e.g., backup or router tweaks)

## Details

### Why it matters
Most infections come from browsers, old apps, and weak defaults. We close the easy doors first: updates, browser safety, and Defender tuned for real-world use.

### When this service is ideal
- New or recently repaired PCs  
- Staff machines that handle email & downloads  
- Parents & students who want safer defaults  
- Anyone tired of nags, pop-ups, and mystery apps

### What you’ll get
Plain-English notes of what we changed and why, plus simple tips for safer daily use (no jargon, no “buy this suite” pressure).

### Turnaround
Usually **same day** (30–60 minutes onsite or in-shop, depending on updates).

### What to bring
Your device and, if prompted, your Microsoft/administrator password for policy changes.

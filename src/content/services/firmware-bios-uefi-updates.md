bullets:
  - Check current BIOS/UEFI and release notes
  - Apply the right vendor update the safe way
  - Verify boot order and key settings after reboot
  - "Quick health check: storage, temps, devices"
faq:
  - q: "Is it risky to update BIOS?"
    a: "There is some risk if power fails or the wrong file is used. We use the maker’s method, stable power, and back up key settings first."
  - q: "Will this fix my hardware issue?"
    a: "It often helps with stability and support for new CPUs, SSDs, RAM, docks, and USB—but it’s not a cure for every fault."
  - q: "What about BitLocker?"
    a: "We suspend BitLocker first so Windows won’t ask for the long recovery key after the update."
  - q: "Can you do this on a laptop with a weak battery?"
    a: "Yes, as long as AC power is solid. If the battery is very weak, we may charge or replace it first."
  - q: "Do you update device firmware too (SSD, dock)?"
    a: "If helpful and safe for your model, yes—we’ll discuss it before we proceed."

**TL;DR:** We update your BIOS/UEFI the right way, keep power stable, and check the PC boots happy after.  
**Local:** Common for SU students, homes in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** teams when new parts won’t play nice.

### Problems we help with
- Random crashes or sleep/resume bugs  
- New CPU/SSD/RAM not detected or unstable  
- Docking station ports flaky; USB issues after wake  
- “Please enter BitLocker key” after a DIY update  
- Old firmware with known security holes

### What’s included
- Check your current BIOS/UEFI and read the maker’s notes  
- Pick the right file and update tool for your model  
- **Safe update** on stable power (AC; UPS on our bench)  
- Bring back the right boot order and settings (TPM, SATA/NVMe mode, fan profile, date/time)  
- Quick health pass: temps, storage SMART, device detection

### How we do it (at a glance)
1) **Identify** exact model and current version  
2) **Prepare**: suspend BitLocker, note key settings, plug into solid power  
3) **Update** using the vendor tool (no random packs)  
4) **Verify**: first boot, BIOS screen, Windows load, temps, fans, USB, Wi-Fi, audio  
5) **Handover**: short note of what changed and simple tips

Plain words. No geek talk.

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Labour:** **R180** per PC  
- **Turnaround:** Often **same day**; very old systems or big bundles may take longer  
- **Add-ons:** SSD/dock firmware updates if helpful (we’ll confirm first)

### Do-nots (to avoid a brick)
- Don’t flash on **low battery** or shaky power  
- Don’t guess the file—use the exact model only  
- Don’t change lots of BIOS settings you don’t know  
- Don’t power off during the update screen

### When to stop DIY & call us
- PC asks for a long **BitLocker key** after your attempt  
- Update tool throws **“image mismatch”** or **“ME region locked”**  
- New CPU/SSD still fails after your own tries  
- Laptop reboots over and over after a flash

### Real stories around town
- **SU first-year (Huis Marais):** NVMe drive not seen. BIOS too old. We updated, set the right storage mode, and Windows installed fine.  
- **Die Boord family PC:** Sleep bug after updates. Fresh BIOS fixed resume and the fans calmed down.  
- **Technopark laptop on a dock:** External screens dead. BIOS + dock firmware brought back all ports.

### Simple tips
- Take a photo of key BIOS pages before you change anything  
- Keep the charger plugged in for the whole update  
- Save your **BitLocker recovery key** in your Microsoft/Company account  
- Update drivers too—see [/services/driver-installation/](/services/driver-installation/)

### What we’ll need
- The **device and charger**  
- Any **BitLocker** or admin passwords if prompted  
- Notes on new parts you’ve added (CPU, SSD, RAM, dock)

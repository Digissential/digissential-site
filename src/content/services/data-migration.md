**TL;DR:** We move your files to a new drive or PC, check they open, and place them where you expect.  
**Local:** Great for SU students, families in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** teams upgrading machines.

### Symptoms we fix
- “New laptop is here, my files are still on the old one.”  
- “I upgraded to an SSD; nothing’s where I left it.”  
- Bookmarks, email, and school/work folders are scattered  
- Old user profiles with duplicate data and messy names

### How we do it (at a glance)
1) **Pick the data:** Docs, Desktop, Pictures, Videos, school/work folders  
2) **Copy safely:** from old device or drive to the new one  
3) **Map folders:** same user names and clean paths so things feel familiar  
4) **Check:** open a sample of files, compare sizes, quick sanity pass  
5) **Optional:** add email accounts, set browser sync, move downloads location  
6) **Handover:** plain notes on what moved and where

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Labour:** **R450** for a standard move between two Windows devices  
- **Extras:** Very large data sets, failing drives, or Mac-to-PC moves may take longer; we’ll quote first  
- **Turnaround:** **Same day to next day**, based on size and drive health

### Do-nots (save time and stress)
- Don’t drag **Program Files** to the new PC and expect apps to work  
- Don’t unplug drives mid-copy  
- Don’t rely on a single, old USB stick as the only copy  
- Don’t skip a quick backup before a risky change — see [/services/data-backup-full-system-image/](/services/data-backup-full-system-image/)

### When to stop DIY & call us
- Source drive **clicks** or gives read errors  
- Windows asks to **format** the old disk  
- Copy runs for hours at 0% or fails over and over  
- You need mail, bookmarks, and app settings moved too

### Real stories around town
- **SU first-year (Huis Marais):** Moved notes and photos from a dying laptop to a new one, set OneDrive, and bookmarks synced by the next lecture.  
- **Die Boord family:** Three users into a shared desktop with clean profiles and a neat photo library. No more “where did that file go?”  
- **Technopark admin PC:** Pre-upgrade copy of accounting and project folders on Friday; new SSD and data ready for Monday.

### What to prepare
- Any **encryption keys** or passwords (BitLocker, user logins)  
- The apps you want on the new PC (installers/keys if needed)  
- Old and new devices (and power cables)

### After migration
You get **plain-English notes** and a quick walk-through so you can find your files fast. We can also add a light backup plan so your new setup stays safe.

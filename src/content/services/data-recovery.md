title: "Data Recovery (Simple / Logical)"
draft: false
category: "Data"
summary: "Best-effort recovery for deleted files or drives that still mount. No clean-room work on failing hardware."
price: R500
bullets:
  - Logical (software-level) recovery only
  - Readable drives that still power on
  - File-list preview when possible
  - Recovered data copied to your storage
faq:
  - q: "Can you recover from a dead or clicking drive?"
    a: "That’s clean-room work (mechanical failure). We can refer you to a specialist lab if needed."
  - q: "Is recovery guaranteed?"
    a: "No. It depends on damage and overwrites. We assess fast and tell you the odds before we try."
  - q: "Will you keep a copy of my files?"
    a: "No by default. If you want a temporary safety copy, we can hold it for a set number of days and then delete."
  - q: "Does TRIM on SSDs make recovery harder?"
    a: "Yes. If files were deleted and the PC stayed on, SSDs may wipe the blocks. Stopping use quickly gives better odds."
  - q: "What storage should I bring?"
    a: "A USB SSD or HDD with enough free space for the recovered data. We can supply one if needed."

**TL;DR:** We try to get your files back from a drive that still powers on. No risky clean-room work here.  
**Local:** Used by SU students, families in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** teams when files vanish at the worst time.

### What’s included
- Check that it’s a **logical** case (not physical failure)  
- Read-only recovery attempt with safe tools  
- **File list preview** when the tool allows it  
- Copy recovered data to **your** storage and open a few to confirm  
- Short report of what we could save

### Problems we can help with
- Files deleted by mistake (Recycle Bin emptied)  
- Light file-system errors; drive mounts but some folders won’t open  
- USB or external drive asks to be scanned, then shows nothing  
- SD cards that still show up but photos are “gone”

### What we don’t do here
- **Clicking** or **dead** drives, liquid damage, head crashes  
- Severe hardware faults — those need a clean-room lab

### How we do it (at a glance)
1) **Quick check:** health signs, SMART, and how the loss happened  
2) **Stabilise:** stop writes; if needed, make a safe clone first  
3) **Recover:** scan the clone or source in read-only mode  
4) **Preview & copy:** save found files to your USB drive  
5) **Verify:** open samples and give you a simple results list

Plain words, no jargon.

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Labour:** **R500** for a standard logical recovery attempt  
- **Extras:** Very large scans or bad-sector cloning may cost more — we’ll confirm first  
- **Turnaround:** **Same day** for small cases; bigger jobs may run overnight

### Do-nots (better odds)
- Don’t install apps or write new files to the same drive  
- Don’t run “PC cleaners” or random recovery tools from the internet  
- Don’t format or run CHKDSK if you care about what’s on there  
- Don’t keep trying a drive that **clicks** — power down and talk to us

### When to stop DIY & call us
- Drive drops off mid-copy or shows **I/O errors**  
- Windows says “You need to format the disk”  
- SSD with recent deletes (time matters)  
- You need help choosing a lab for a clicking drive

### Real stories around town
- **SU first-year (Huis Marais):** Emptied the bin with a draft essay inside. We scanned fast and got the DOCX back the same afternoon.  
- **Die Boord family:** External drive “opened” but photos showed as 0 KB. We cloned, ran a safe scan, and recovered the album.  
- **Technopark SME:** Project folder vanished after a sync mess. We pulled prior versions and set a sane backup plan to stop repeats.

### Simple care tips
- Save work to one main folder tree (Docs/Pictures) so recovery scans have clear targets  
- Keep one **offline** or **cloud** backup — see [/services/cloud-backup-setup/](/services/cloud-backup-setup/)  
- After a big save or photo import, run a quick backup so the next mistake is painless

### What to bring
- The device or bare drive, plus a USB SSD/HDD with enough free space  
- Any passwords or BitLocker keys if the drive is encrypted

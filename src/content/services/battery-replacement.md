category: "Hardware"
summary: "We fit a genuine or trusted-brand battery, update firmware if needed, and calibrate it so your laptop runs longer."
price: R450
featured: false
bullets:
  - Careful disassembly and refit (no torn ribbons or missing screws)
  - Connector & charge-circuit checks; DC-in and board inspection
  - Firmware/EC update if the model needs it
  - Basic calibration with a short health report
faq:
  - q: "Do you supply batteries?"
    a: "Yes — OEM or vetted high-quality compatibles. If you bring your own, we’ll still check the part number and health before fitting."
  - q: "Will the battery % be accurate?"
    a: "We run a basic calibration. Some models learn over 2–3 charge cycles — that’s normal."
  - q: "How long does it take?"
    a: "Once the right battery is on hand, many swaps are same-day. Some ultrabooks take longer due to glue and adhesive strips."
  - q: "What if it’s not the battery?"
    a: "We test first. If a charge port or board is the real fault, we’ll say so and quote that job instead of wasting your money."
  - q: "Is there a warranty?"
    a: "Yes. Labour is covered, and parts we supply have a fair warranty. We explain it on handover."
  - q: "Can you recycle my old battery?"
    a: "Yes. We route e-waste safely on request."

**TL;DR:** Fast, careful laptop battery swap with calibration and a short health report.  
**Local:** Popular with SU students and Technopark staff when a laptop dies off-charger or drains too fast in lectures or meetings.

### Symptoms we fix
- Laptop dies the moment the charger comes out  
- Battery stays at 1–10% or jumps around wildly  
- “Plugged in, not charging” even with a good adapter  
- Swollen pack lifts the touchpad or bottom cover  
- Fans race and the case feels warm during simple tasks

### How we do it (at a glance)
We start with a quick power and health check. We open the laptop with the right bits (no prying with knives), unplug the pack safely, and clean the area. We fit the new battery, reseat ribbons, check the DC-in and board for damage, and run a short test. If your model needs an EC/BIOS tweak, we do that too. Then we set a simple charge-cycle plan so the gauge learns fast.

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Labour:** **R450** for standard models (ultrabooks with glue may be a bit more; we’ll confirm first).  
- **Battery part:** Varies by model. Common ranges **R600–R1 800**; premium or rare packs can be higher.  
- **Turnaround:** Often **same day** once the right part is on hand. Parts lead-time is usually 1–3 working days.

### Do-nots (to protect your laptop)
- Don’t keep using a **swollen** battery — it can bend the frame or crack the touchpad.  
- Don’t poke the pack or peel it off with a knife — it can smoke or catch fire.  
- Don’t trust “battery booster” apps — they don’t fix bad chemistry.  
- Don’t ignore **“plugged in, not charging”** — it can be the port or board; forcing it can make it worse.

### When to stop DIY & call us
- Touchpad sits high or clicks from pressure  
- Sweet/burnt smell from the bottom case  
- Laptop shuts off at 30–50% under light use  
- Won’t power on with battery connected, but starts on charger with the pack unplugged  
- You replaced the pack and it still won’t take a charge

### Real-world notes from around town
- **SU campus (Neelsie study spots):** We see laptops that die mid-lecture because the old pack is at 60% wear. A fresh pack plus a clean start-up list keeps it alive the full day.  
- **Die Boord / Welgevonden homes:** Many family laptops live on the charger 24/7. We set sane charge limits where the model allows it to make the new pack last longer.  
- **Technopark SMEs:** Store and front-desk laptops need steady power for POS and email. We pair a new pack with a small UPS for the router so work doesn’t stop during load-shedding.

### Simple care tips (longer life)
- Keep the vents clear and the laptop off blankets  
- Aim for shallow charge cycles (30–80%) when you can  
- Update BIOS/EC when we recommend it (we’ll note it at handover)  
- If the laptop will sit for weeks, store at ~50% and power it up monthly

### Need help choosing the right battery?
If you’re buying your own part, ask us to check the **part number** and **connector** first. Many “fits model XYZ” listings are wrong by one pin or mounting hole. We’re happy to sanity-check before you spend.

**TL;DR:** We connect to your PC **remotely**, fix common software problems, and guide you as we go—no call-out needed.  
**Local:** Great for SU students, homes in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** teams who need quick help.

### Problems we fix
- Email won’t add, keeps asking for a password  
- “Driver unavailable” or printer won’t show  
- Slow start-up, pop-ups, noisy start-up apps  
- Windows updates failing or stuck  
- Browser homepage changed by adware  
- Small Wi-Fi or file-sharing hiccups

### What’s included
- A **secure session link** (you approve it)  
- **Live troubleshooting** with plain words  
- **Updates & clean-up** where helpful  
- A short **notes sheet**: what we changed and next steps

### How we work (at a glance)
1) **Book a slot** that suits you  
2) **Connect securely** with your OK (you’ll see everything)  
3) **Fix & explain**: we talk you through the steps  
4) **Test**: print a page, send an email, reboot if needed  
5) **Handover**: simple notes you can keep

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **R350/hr**, billed in **30-minute** blocks (30-minute minimum)  
- **Turnaround:** Often **same day**  
- **After-hours?** Use [/services/labour-after-hours-emergency/](/services/labour-after-hours-emergency/)  
- **On-site needed?** Add [/services/on-site-surcharge-within-20km/](/services/on-site-surcharge-within-20km/)

### Do-nots (save time and stress)
- Don’t install random “cleaners” from ads  
- Don’t click every “fix now” pop-up  
- Don’t set three antivirus apps—they fight each other  
- Don’t keep retrying a stuck update during a deadline—call us

### When to stop DIY & call us
- Printer shows “driver unavailable” after updates  
- Outlook or Gmail loops sign-in  
- Browser keeps opening to ads  
- PC is slow at start and fans roar  
- Updates fail again and again

### Real stories around town
- **SU first-year (Huis Marais):** Email kept asking for a password. We fixed 2-step sign-in and it synced in minutes.  
- **Die Boord home office:** Printer worked on one PC but not the other. We cleaned the old driver and set a steady setup—test page done.  
- **Technopark staffer:** Windows update loop at 8 am. We cleared the cache, installed the right patch, and meetings ran on time.

### Simple tips
- Let Windows update on a quiet evening weekly  
- Keep one strong passphrase in a password manager  
- Remove browser add-ons you don’t use  
- Keep printer and PC on the **same Wi-Fi** (not guest)

### What you need
- **Stable internet** and your **Windows/macOS login**  
- Time to **approve the connection** and a quick reboot if asked  
- For email: your **mail password** and phone for 2-step codes

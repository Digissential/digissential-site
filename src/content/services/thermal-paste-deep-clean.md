title: "Thermal Paste & Deep Clean"
draft: false
category: "Hardware"
summary: "Lower temps and noise. We replace old paste, clean fans and heatsinks, and clear dust the safe way."
price: R350
featured: false
bullets:
  - Old paste removed; fresh high-quality paste applied
  - Fans, heatsinks, and vents deep-cleaned
  - Quick airflow and noise check
  - Optional thermal pad replacement on request
faq:
  - q: "How much cooler will it run?"
    a: "It varies, but dried paste and clogged fins can add 10–20°C. After a clean, temps drop and fans don’t shout as much."
  - q: "Do you undervolt or retune?"
    a: "If your model supports it, we can suggest gentle tweaks. Bigger tuning is a separate job."
  - q: "Is this safe for thin laptops?"
    a: "Yes. We use the right tools and take our time with tiny screws and ribbons."
  - q: "My PC has liquid cooling—do you service that?"
    a: "We clean dust and the radiator. Full liquid swaps or leaks are quoted as a separate repair."
  - q: "Will you replace thermal pads?"
    a: "If pads look tired or torn, we can replace them with matching thickness on request."

**TL;DR:** Your PC runs hot and loud? We clean the dust, swap old paste for fresh, and check temps so it runs cooler and quieter.  
**Local:** Popular with SU students, homes in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** offices where noise kills focus.

### Symptoms we fix
- Fans roar even when you open a browser  
- Laptop burns your lap; case feels hot at idle  
- Games or calls make the PC throttle or shut down  
- CPU or GPU hits the red fast and stays there  
- Dust bunnies peeking through the vents

### What’s included
- Safe **disassembly** and dust removal (no leaf blowers)  
- Old paste **removed** and fresh, quality paste **applied** to CPU/GPU (where reachable)  
- **Heatsinks and fans** cleaned; vents cleared  
- **Quick thermal test** and a short noise check  
- Plain-English handover notes

### How we do it (at a glance)
1) **Open up:** small trays, panels, and shrouds off with care  
2) **Clean:** soft brushes and air; hold fans still so bearings live long  
3) **Repaste:** clean contact, fresh paste, even pressure on screws  
4) **Rebuild:** route cables neatly; no trapped ribbons  
5) **Test:** warm the system, watch temps and fan behavior, check under light load and a short burst

Plain words. No tech talk.

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Service fee:** **R350** per device  
- **Turnaround:** Often **same day** (some models take longer to open)  
- **Extras:** Thermal pad swaps or heavy dust jobs may add a small materials/time cost—we’ll confirm first

### Do-nots (save parts and cash)
- Don’t spray fans while they spin—bearings hate that  
- Don’t use kitchen grease or toothpaste as “paste”  
- Don’t block vents with blankets or a couch  
- Don’t ignore a **swollen battery** lifting the deck—stop and call

### When to stop DIY & call us
- Laptop shuts off under load or smells hot  
- Screws are stripped or a ribbon is at risk  
- Temps spike at idle after your own attempt  
- You see liquid stains or old spill marks near the fan

### Real stories around town
- **SU first-year (Huis Marais):** Gaming laptop hit 95°C and screamed. Clean + fresh paste dropped it ~15°C and it stayed quiet in class.  
- **Die Boord family PC:** Dust cake on the cooler. We cleaned, repasted, and the fan stopped howling during Zoom.  
- **Technopark CAD box:** Thermal paste dried out; CPU throttled. After a clean, renders ran steady without dips.

### Simple care tips
- Keep the case off carpet; dust the front mesh now and then  
- Use a laptop stand so vents can breathe  
- Vacuum the area near the PC; less dust in means less dust to clean  
- Let Windows update on a quiet night—old drivers can run hotter

### What to bring
- The **device and charger/power cable**  
- Any notes about **noise** or times it gets hot  
- If it was dropped or spilled, tell us—helps us plan

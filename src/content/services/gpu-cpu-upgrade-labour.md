title: "GPU/CPU Upgrade (Labour)"
draft: false
category: "Hardware"
summary: "Install and validate a new GPU or CPU with safe handling, power/cooling checks, and clean drivers."
price: R400
featured: false
bullets:
  - Anti-static handling and correct fitment
  - PSU and cooling headroom checks; BIOS sanity
  - Driver clean and install (DDU option)
  - Brief stress and thermals validation
faq:
  - q: "What if I need a clean driver pass?"
    a: "We can run DDU and reinstall graphics drivers. With extended stress testing, the labour is R550."
  - q: "Will my PSU be enough?"
    a: "We check maker guidance and rails. If it’s borderline, we suggest a safe model before we fit the part."
  - q: "Do you update BIOS for new CPUs?"
    a: "If needed, yes. We’ll confirm the version and quote that step if your board needs it."
  - q: "Will you repaste the CPU?"
    a: "Yes, we apply fresh quality thermal paste on CPU swaps."
  - q: "Can you help pick the right part?"
    a: "Yes. See our [/services/custom-pc-build-advice/](/services/custom-pc-build-advice/) or ask for a quick check."

**TL;DR:** We fit your new GPU or CPU the right way, check power and temps, and make sure games and apps run smooth.  
**Local:** Popular with SU students and **Technopark** teams who want more speed without buying a whole new PC.

### Symptoms we help with
- Games stutter or crash; low FPS vs what you expected  
- CPU sits at 100% and the fan screams  
- New GPU shows “not enough power” or black screens  
- PC shuts off under load or reboots mid-match  
- Temps jump fast after a DIY swap

### How we do it (at a glance)
1) **Quick check:** case space, PSU headroom, BIOS version  
2) **Fit the part:** seat CPU/GPU, apply fresh paste, tidy cables  
3) **Update:** BIOS (if needed) and clean driver install (DDU option for GPUs)  
4) **Test:** POST, Windows load, short stress and temp check  
5) **Handover:** simple notes, next best upgrade (if any), and care tips

Plain words. No tech jargon.

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Labour (standard):** **R400** for a GPU **or** CPU fit with short tests  
- **DDU + extended stress tier:** **R550** (clean driver pass + longer load test)  
- **Extras:** New cooler brackets, tricky cases, or BIOS work may add time (we’ll confirm first)  
- **Turnaround:** Often **same day** if no extra parts are needed

### Do-nots (save parts and cash)
- Don’t run a hungry GPU on a tiny, old PSU  
- Don’t force a CPU cooler—check standoffs and height  
- Don’t peel SSD/GPU thermal labels that act as heatsinks  
- Don’t forget the 8-pin/12-pin GPU cables or bend adapters too tight

### When to stop DIY & call us
- PC won’t power on after the swap  
- Smell of burnt plastic or a small “pop”  
- GPU fans spin but no display  
- BIOS can’t see the new CPU or temps spike at idle

### Real stories around town
- **SU first-year (Huis Marais):** Swapped to a used GPU; games crashed. We did DDU, checked PSU rails, and set a better fan curve. Smooth after.  
- **Welgevonden family PC:** CPU upgrade for photo edits. Fresh paste and a better cooler dropped temps by 15°C. Quieter too.  
- **Technopark CAD box:** New GPU sagging and hot. We added a support, improved cables, and temps fell under load.

### Simple tips
- Aim the budget at the part that helps your goal (GPU for games; CPU/RAM for edits)  
- Keep the case off carpet and clear the front mesh for airflow  
- Set a calm fan curve so boost holds steady without noise  
- Use a small UPS for the router and PC to ride out load-shedding

### What to bring
- The PC and **power cable** (for desktops) or the **laptop + charger**  
- The **new GPU or CPU** (and cooler, if changing)  
- Any boxes/brackets that came with the part

title: "Data Recovery (Simple / Logical)"
summary: "Best-effort recovery for deleted files or drives that still mount. No risky clean-room work on failing hardware."
price: "R500"
category: "Data"
featured: false
bullets:
  - Logical (software-level) recovery only
  - Readable drives that still power on
  - File-list preview when possible
  - Recovered data copied to your storage
faq:
  - q: "Can you recover from a dead or clicking drive?"
    a: "That’s clean-room work (mechanical failure). We can refer you to a specialist lab if needed."
  - q: "Is recovery guaranteed?"

## What’s included
- Assessment to confirm a **logical** case (not physical)  
- Recovery attempt with safe, read-only tooling  
- Copy recovered data to your storage and verify openability  
- Summary report of what was recovered

## Details

### Typical cases we can help with
- Recently deleted files (especially on SSDs where trim hasn’t run yet)  
- Light file-system corruption  
- External drives that mount but won’t open certain folders

### What we don’t do here
- Clicking/failed disks, liquid damage, head crashes (clean-room only)

### Turnaround
Same day for small cases; larger jobs may require overnight cloning first.

summary: "Get a parts list that fits your needs, budget, and case—no bottlenecks, no guesswork."
price: R350
featured: false
bullets:
  - Tailored parts list (CPU/GPU/RAM/SSD/PSU/case/cooler)
  - Compatibility and airflow checks for your case
  - Targets set by your apps, games, and monitor
  - Upgrade path planning and quiet/noise goals
faq:
  - q: "Can you optimise for my apps or games?"
    a: "Yes. Tell us what you use (Lightroom, DaVinci, CAD, AAA games), your monitor res/refresh, and we tune the build."
  - q: "Can you also assemble it?"
    a: "Yes — see [/services/pc-assembly-full-build/](/services/pc-assembly-full-build/). We can also source parts if you prefer."
  - q: "Can you help me buy from local stores?"
    a: "Sure. We link to trusted SA sellers and list prices so you can choose."
  - q: "Will it be quiet?"
    a: "We pick coolers, cases, and fan curves with noise targets in mind. You choose silent, flashy RGB, or clean and simple."
  - q: "Do you do small form factor (SFF)?"
    a: "Yes. SFF needs careful picks for heat and fit. We’ll map it so it works and stays stable."
  - q: "Windows license and setup?"
    a: "If we build it, we can install Windows and drivers. If you self-build, we give a short step-by-step guide."

**TL;DR:** We plan your PC the smart way, pick parts that work well together, and keep it on budget.  
**Local:** Popular with SU students, families in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** teams who want speed without waste.

### Problems we solve
- Too many “best build” guides and you’re lost  
- Parts don’t fit the case, or the GPU is too long  
- Games stutter even on a “fast” chip  
- Loud fans, hot case, random restarts  
- Power supply is tiny or a sketchy brand  
- Money locked in the wrong part (big CPU, tiny GPU)

### How we do it (at a glance)
1) **Quick chat:** Budget, what you do, and what “fast” means to you  
2) **Target:** Your monitor resolution/refresh and key apps  
3) **Shortlist:** CPU/GPU/RAM/SSD/PSU/case/cooler that match the target  
4) **Fit check:** Size, airflow, cables, and power draw  
5) **Tweak:** Quiet vs flashy, future upgrades, and cable neatness  
6) **Plan:** Final parts list with links, prices, and reasons

You get a clear write-up you can shop from today.

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Advice fee:** **R350** for one complete build plan (plus a budget or performance variant if helpful)  
- **Turnaround:** Often **same day** once we have your needs and model notes  
- **Add-ons:** We can assemble, install Windows, and load drivers — see [/services/pc-assembly-full-build/](/services/pc-assembly-full-build/)

### Do-nots (save cash and stress)
- Don’t buy a huge CPU for 1080p gaming and then pair it with a tiny GPU  
- Don’t cheap out on the PSU — a bad unit can kill parts  
- Don’t assume any big GPU fits in any case  
- Don’t mix odd RAM kits and expect smooth high speeds  
- Don’t pick a DRAM-less SSD for heavy video or photo work

### When to call us
- Cart is ready but you want a second pair of eyes  
- You built it and it runs hot or loud  
- It won’t boot, or shuts off under load  
- You want small and quiet, but also cool and fast — we balance it

### Real stories around town
- **SU first-year (Huis Marais):** Wanted a “streaming PC.” We shifted spend from CPU to GPU, added 32 GB RAM, and a better cooler. Same budget, smooth 1440p.  
- **Welgevonden family:** Dad wanted quiet homework/gaming mix. Mesh case, silent fans, mid GPU. Kid plays Valorant, house stays calm.  
- **Technopark dev team:** Needed snappy compile times. We specced a strong CPU, 64 GB RAM, and two NVMe drives. Work got faster without server prices.

### What you get
- A **curated parts plan** with SA links and prices  
- **Why each part**: short notes in plain words  
- **Upgrade map**: drop-in CPU, more RAM, second NVMe, bigger GPU class  
- **Noise/airflow plan**: fan curve idea and cooler choice  
- **Cable and build tips** if you DIY

### Simple tips for a happy build
- Aim the budget at the part that matters for your goal (GPU for games, CPU/RAM/SSD for edits)  
- Keep the case off carpet and clear the front mesh  
- Label cables as you go; it pays off later  
- Use a small UPS for the router and PC to ride out load-shedding

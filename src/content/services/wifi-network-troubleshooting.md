## What’s included
- Configure your **router or access point** securely (WPA2/3 as supported).

- Adjust SSID, guest network, and basic parental controls (on request).  
- Walk-through and **handover notes** in plain English.

## Details

### When this service is ideal
- New router/AP, fibre changeover, or moving home/office.  
- Wi-Fi drops, poor coverage, or slow speeds at peak times.

### What we’ll need
- Your ISP/fibre details (PPPoE, VLAN/bridge, etc.) if applicable.  
- Access to the router/AP and a few rooms to test coverage.

### Turnaround
Usually **same day** (30–60 minutes depending on complexity).

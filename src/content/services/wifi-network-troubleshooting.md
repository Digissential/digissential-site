**TL;DR:** Your Wi-Fi drops or crawls? We set the router/AP the right way, pick calmer channels, and test rooms so it just works.  
**Local:** Great for SU student houses in **Idas Valley**, families in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** offices.

### Problems we fix
- Fast near the router, slow two rooms away  
- Zoom/Teams stutter or drop on walks between rooms  
- Printer/TV won’t stay on the network  
- “Wrong password” after a new router or fibre change  
- Phones jump between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz and then stall  
- Guest Wi-Fi hides devices you need to reach

### What’s included
- Secure **router/AP setup** (WPA2/3 where supported)  
- **Channel and band** tuning to reduce noise from neighbours  
- SSID and **guest Wi-Fi** setup; light parental rules on request  
- **Coverage and speed** spot-checks in key rooms  
- **Plain notes** with your Wi-Fi name, password, and tips

### How we do it (at a glance)
1) **Quick chat:** your layout, ISP, and pain spots  
2) **Connect right:** PPPoE/VLAN/bridge if needed  
3) **Plan bands:** pick calm channels and set band steering smartly  
4) **Place smart:** small nudge to router/AP position if it helps  
5) **Test:** speed and roaming while we walk the space  
6) **Handover:** simple notes and next steps (mesh advise if needed)

Plain words. No network jargon.

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Fee:** **R350** for one router/AP session  
- **Turnaround:** Often **same day** (30–60 minutes typical)  
- **On-site option:** Add [/services/on-site-surcharge-within-20km/](/services/on-site-surcharge-within-20km/) if we come to you  
- **Bigger homes/offices:** See [/services/mesh-wifi-planning-install/](/services/mesh-wifi-planning-install/)

### Do-nots (save time and money)
- Don’t chain cheap **extenders** — each hop cuts speed  
- Don’t hide the router in a metal cabinet or behind a TV  
- Don’t split into five SSIDs “for each room” — roaming breaks  
- Don’t put printers on **guest Wi-Fi** — PCs can’t see them there

### When to stop DIY & call us
- Speed is fine next to the router but useless in bedrooms  
- Wi-Fi drops every night or after sleep  
- Printer works on one PC but not the others  
- Calls freeze when you walk from lounge to kitchen  
- New fibre router and nothing else talks to it

### Real stories around town
- **SU digs (Idas Valley):** Two brick walls killed lounge signal. Channel plan + better placement made calls smooth.  
- **Die Boord double-storey:** Router in a cupboard. We moved it out, set a guest SSID, and Netflix stopped buffering.  
- **Technopark boardroom:** Wi-Fi died when full. We tuned channels and set a steady band plan. Meetings held.

### Simple tips
- Keep the router in the open, chest height if possible  
- Name one main SSID for all devices; add one **guest** if you need it  
- Put the ONT + main node on a small **UPS** to ride out load-shedding  
- Update router firmware when the maker app says so

### What we’ll need
- **ISP details** (PPPoE user/pass or bridge info)  
- Access to the router/AP and a few rooms for tests  
- Your current **Wi-Fi name/password** (we can change it with your OK)

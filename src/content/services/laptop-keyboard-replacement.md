**TL;DR:** We replace your laptop keyboard the right way and test every key, backlight, and shortcut.  
**Local:** Common for SU students, homes in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** teams after wear or a spill.

### Symptoms we fix
- Sticky keys, dead rows, or double-typing  
- Backlight won’t turn on or is uneven  
- Keys pop off or feel sunken  
- Function keys, volume/brightness, or NumPad not working  
- After a spill, keys feel gummy or don’t respond

### How we do it (at a glance)
1) **Check model & layout:** match language, backlight, and screw map  
2) **Open cleanly:** right bits, no “pry and hope,” protect cables  
3) **Fit part:** seat ribbon, lock connectors, set strain relief  
4) **Test:** full key-matrix, function row, backlight steps, sleep/wake  
5) **Handover:** short notes and care tips

Plain words. No tech talk.

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Labour:** **R450** for a standard keyboard swap  
- **Top-case models:** we quote the full assembly if your brand uses rivets/glue  
- **Parts:** priced by model; we confirm before we order  
- **Turnaround:** **Same day to 2 days** once parts arrive

### Do-nots (save time and cash)
- Don’t pull keycaps on thin scissor switches — they break fast  
- Don’t keep typing on a wet keyboard — power down and unplug  
- Don’t use super glue on keys — it spreads and ruins the deck  
- Don’t bend the ribbon — sharp folds kill traces

### When to stop DIY & call us
- Keys in a full row don’t work (likely ribbon or matrix)  
- Backlight shorted after a spill  
- Keyboard only works when you push the deck  
- You see corrosion under the keys

### Real stories around town
- **SU first-year (Huis Marais):** Spacebar double-typed. New keyboard, firmware check, all good by afternoon.  
- **Die Boord home office:** Tea spill. We cleaned, checked for board damage, and swapped the top-case. Typing felt new.  
- **Technopark sales laptop:** Function row dead. Reseated ribbon and replaced the worn deck. Hotkeys back.

### Simple care tips
- Keep drinks away from the palm rest (we know, easier said than done)  
- Use a light air blow to clear crumbs, not sharp tools  
- Close the lid gently; don’t leave pens on the keyboard  
- If a spill happens: power off, unplug, flip open like a tent, and call

### What’s included
- Keyboard or top-case replacement using the proper method  
- Backlight, layout, and full key-matrix testing  
- Connector seating and screw torque checks

### Turnaround
- **Same day** for simple swaps  
- **1–2 days** when a top-case or extra curing/parts are needed

### What to bring
- The laptop and **charger**  
- Notes on which keys fail and any recent **spill** or **drop**  
- If layout isn’t standard (e.g., US–Intl), tell us so we match it

**TL;DR:** Locked out of a **local** Windows account? We verify ID, reset the password, and keep your files and apps.  
**Local:** Handy for SU students, homes in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** teams with a stuck login.

### Problems we fix
- “Wrong password” on a local account  
- You forgot the PIN and can’t reach the desktop  
- A hand-me-down PC still has the old owner’s local account  
- You changed the password and Windows won’t accept it

### What’s included
- **ID check** and proof of ownership  
- Safe **password reset** for a *local* Windows account  
- Quick review of **sign-in options** (PIN, Windows Hello)  
- Simple notes on keeping access safe next time

### How we do it (at a glance)
1) **Verify**: quick ID and ownership check  
2) **Check**: BitLocker/EFS status so we don’t lock data  
3) **Reset**: set a new local password the safe way  
4) **Sign in** and test your desktop and files  
5) **Tidy up**: add a PIN/Hello, update hints, and note recovery steps

Plain words. No tech speak.

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Fee:** **R250** per device  
- **Turnaround:** Often **same day** (10–30 minutes once verified)  
- **On-site option:** Add the [/services/on-site-surcharge-within-20km/](/services/on-site-surcharge-within-20km/) if we come to you

### Do-nots (to protect your data)
- Don’t run random “password crack” tools from the web  
- Don’t factory-reset if you care about the files  
- Don’t guess passwords until the account locks out  
- Don’t change BIOS or disk settings if you have **BitLocker** and no key

### When to stop DIY & call us
- You see a **BitLocker recovery** screen and don’t have the key  
- The account is the *only* admin and you can’t get in  
- The PC shows **“user profile service failed”** at login  
- You suspect **EFS encryption** was used for files

### Real stories around town
- **SU first-year (Huis Marais):** Forgot the PIN after a Windows update. We reset the local password, set a new PIN, and he was back in class.  
- **Die Boord family PC:** Old owner account still on the machine. We verified, made a new local admin, and cleaned the sign-in.  
- **Technopark laptop:** Local admin password lost. BitLocker key was saved in the Microsoft account, so we signed in, used the key, and set a fresh login.

### Simple tips
- Save your **BitLocker key** in your Microsoft account or print it  
- Add a **PIN** or **Windows Hello** for quick sign-ins  
- Keep a second **local admin** for emergencies  
- Write a tiny hint that only *you* understand

### What we’ll need
- The **PC and charger**  
- Your **ID** and proof the device is yours (invoice, email, or a clear handover)  
- Any **BitLocker key** shown on screen or stored in your account

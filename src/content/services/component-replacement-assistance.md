**TL;DR:** We fit your new parts the right way, test them, and make sure the PC boots happy.  
**Local:** Popular with SU students and **Technopark** teams who want a faster, quieter machine without buying new.

### Symptoms we help with
- Games stutter, apps crawl, or tabs freeze  
- PC shuts off under load or gives random restarts  
- Fans roar all the time, case feels hot  
- Noisy hard drive, long start-up times  
- “Not enough power” or “device not detected” after a DIY part swap

### How we do it (at a glance)
1) **Quick check:** Model, space, power needs, and BIOS version  
2) **Fit the part:** RAM, SSD, GPU, PSU, or fans — neat cables, no broken clips  
3) **Update if needed:** BIOS/firmware so the new part plays nice  
4) **Test:** Power-on, POST, Windows load, temps, quick stress test  
5) **Handover:** What changed, simple care tips, and next best upgrade (if any)

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Labour:** **R400** per standard part swap (some jobs—tight ultrabooks, full rewire—may cost a bit more; we confirm first)  
- **Parts:** Billed at store price; we’ll quote to the rand before you buy  
- **Turnaround:** Often **same day** if parts are on hand; 1–3 working days if we need to source

### Do-nots (to save time and money)
- Don’t force a GPU/ RAM stick that won’t seat — it can crack the slot  
- Don’t mix odd RAM kits and expect them to run fast  
- Don’t run a new GPU on a tiny, old power supply  
- Don’t peel a glued SSD heat label — some are part of the cooler  
- Don’t keep using a PC that smells hot or clicks — stop and call

### When to stop DIY & call us
- PC won’t power on after a swap  
- You hear a pop, see smoke, or smell burnt plastic  
- BIOS can’t see the new drive  
- Random blue screens after “it worked once”  
- Case has no airflow and temps spike fast

### Real-world notes from around town
- **SU res rooms:** We see study laptops that lag with many Chrome tabs. A simple **RAM + SSD** upgrade made one first-year’s PC boot in 15 seconds and handle notes, Zoom, and Spotify with ease.  
- **Die Boord / Welgevonden homes:** Family desktops run loud. We swap in quiet fans and a tidy cable job. Noise drops, dust build-up slows.  
- **Technopark SMEs:** Office PCs freeze during big spreadsheets. We add RAM, a fast SSD, and a small UPS for the router. Staff keep working even during load-shedding.

### Simple care tips
- Keep the case off the carpet and clear the vents  
- Blow dust out every few months (we can show you how)  
- Don’t block the front or top fans with papers or boxes  
- Update Windows and drivers on a calm day, not mid-deadline

### Parts & warranty
Parts are billed separately. You keep all OEM/retail cover. Our labour warranty covers the install work. If a part fails under its own warranty, we help you process it.

### What to bring
The PC or laptop, new part(s) if you have them, and the power cable/charger. If we’re moving to an SSD, bring the old drive too so we can clone it.

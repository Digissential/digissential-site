**TL;DR:** We replace your laptop screen the right way, then test colours, brightness, webcam, and lid movement.  
**Local:** Common for SU students, homes in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** teams after drops or bag pressure.

### Symptoms we fix
- Cracked glass, ink-like black patches, or spider lines  
- White/coloured vertical lines or half the screen frozen  
- Dim/backlight out, flicker on certain angles  
- Image shows on an external monitor but not on the laptop  
- Touch not responding (for touch models)

### How we do it (at a glance)
1) **Confirm spec:** size, resolution, refresh rate, connector (eDP 30/40-pin), touch/non-touch  
2) **Open cleanly:** safe bezel removal, protect hinges and cables  
3) **Fit panel:** seat cable fully, lock connector, route with strain relief  
4) **Test:** brightness steps, colour uniformity, backlight bleed, webcam/mic (if in bezel), sleep/wake and lid angles  
5) **Finish:** lint-free clean, secure screws/clips, and a short care note

Plain words. No tech talk.

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Labour:** **R650** for standard models  
- **Panel part:** Typical **R900–R3 500** depending on model/spec; we quote before ordering  
- **Turnaround:** Usually **1–2 days** once the panel arrives (common parts 1–3 working days to source)  
- **Extras:** Touch/bonded units or damaged hinges/cables may add time/cost — we’ll confirm first

### Do-nots (save the laptop and your fingers)
- Don’t keep pressing a cracked panel — it spreads damage  
- Don’t shut the lid hard or put books on it in your bag  
- Don’t peel the bezel by force — hidden clips break  
- Don’t ignore a screen being pushed up by the palmrest — it can be a **swollen battery** (stop and call)

### When to stop DIY & call us
- Black blotches grow across the panel  
- Vertical lines appear after opening the lid  
- Backlight pops and the screen goes dark  
- Liquid at the top bezel or under the glass  
- External monitor works but the laptop panel stays black

### Real stories around town
- **SU first-year (Huis Marais):** Closed the lid on a flash drive. New 1080p panel fitted; colours checked; back in class next day.  
- **Die Boord family laptop:** Flicker at certain angles; cable had wear at the hinge. New cable + panel and it was rock solid.  
- **Technopark sales laptop:** Matte upgrade with better viewing angles. We matched the right connector and it looked great in meetings.

### Simple care tips
- Use a sleeve in your backpack; don’t pack heavy books against the lid  
- Open from the **centre** with two hands to reduce twist  
- Keep liquids away from the bezel/top edge  
- If it slips off a desk, tell us — we’ll check hinges and cable too

### What’s included
- Source and fit a compatible panel for your model  
- Inspect and reseat the display cable/connector  
- Test brightness/colour, backlight bleed, webcam/mic (if applicable)  
- Clean, lint-free finish and clear handover notes

### Notes about damage
Falls and liquid can also hurt **hinges** and **display cables**. If we find extra damage during disassembly, we’ll pause and call you with options.

### Turnaround
Usually **1–2 days** once the panel arrives.

### What to bring
- The laptop and **charger**  
- Model number or a photo of the bottom label (panel code helps too)  
- Tell us if there was a **fall** or **spill**

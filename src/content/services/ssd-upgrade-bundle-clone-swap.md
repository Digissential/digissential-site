title: "SSD Upgrade Bundle (Clone & Swap)"
draft: false
category: "Hardware"
summary: "We clone your old drive to a new SSD, fit it, expand the space, and make sure it boots fast and your apps still work."
price: R450
featured: false
bullets:
  - NVMe/SATA compatibility check
  - Sector-by-sector clone with integrity check
  - Partition expand so you get all the space
  - Boot and app launch verification
faq:
  - q: "Will everything look the same after the swap?"
    a: "Yes. A clone keeps your apps, files, and layout the same—just faster and with more space."
  - q: "What if the old drive is failing?"
    a: "We switch to a safer imaging mode and try to pull as much as we can. If it’s very bad, we’ll chat about recovery options first."
  - q: "Do I need a new Windows license?"
    a: "No. Windows stays activated on the same machine in almost all cases."
  - q: "HDD to SSD—will it be much faster?"
    a: "Yes. Boots and app opens are usually many times quicker."
  - q: "BitLocker or passwords—do these matter?"
    a: "If BitLocker is on, bring the recovery key. We won’t bypass it. You’ll type passwords yourself when needed."
  - q: "Can you put the old drive in a USB case?"
    a: "Yes. We can fit it in a USB enclosure for extra storage if the drive is healthy."

**TL;DR:** We copy your whole drive to a new SSD, swap it in, give you all the space, and make sure it boots and runs smooth.  
**Local:** Popular with SU students, homes in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** teams who want a quick speed boost.

### Problems we fix
- **Slow boot** and apps that take ages to open  
- Disk sits at **100%** in Task Manager  
- Running out of space for work or games  
- Old HDD is noisy or feels like it might fail  
- You want speed without reinstalling everything

### What’s included
- **Model check:** NVMe/SATA fit, screws, caddies, and slot  
- **Clone** of your drive with an **integrity check**  
- **Physical swap** with neat cables and tidy routing  
- **Expand the main partition** to use all new space  
- **Boot test** and quick app launch check  
- Short handover notes in plain words

### How we do it (at a glance)
1) **Check parts:** NVMe vs SATA, thickness, heatsink fit, spare bay  
2) **Health peek:** SMART check on the old drive  
3) **Clone:** sector or smart mode, verify results  
4) **Swap:** install SSD, set boot order, confirm UEFI  
5) **Expand space:** grow the C: drive so you get the full capacity  
6) **Test:** boot, login, apps, TRIM on, temps fine  
7) **Handover:** simple notes and care tips

Plain words. No tech talk.

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Bundle labour:** **R450** (clone + swap + checks)  
- **SSD part:** priced by size/brand (we’ll quote options you can trust)  
- **Turnaround:** Often **same day**; very full or weak drives may need overnight  
- **Extras (optional):** USB enclosure for the old drive; cables/brackets for desktops

### Do-nots (save data and cash)
- Don’t format the old drive until we say the new one is perfect  
- Don’t keep using a **clicking** drive—clone it now  
- Don’t defrag an SSD (ever)  
- Don’t clone over a weak USB 2.0 adapter for NVMe—too slow and risky

### When to stop DIY & call us
- Clones fail or **Windows won’t boot** after a DIY swap  
- Old drive throws SMART warnings or odd noises  
- Laptop has no spare screws/caddy and you’re stuck  
- You need the space grown but fear touching partitions

### Real stories around town
- **SU first-year (Huis Marais):** 500GB HDD to 1TB SSD. Boot dropped from minutes to seconds; same apps, just faster.  
- **Die Boord family PC:** “Disk 100%” all day. We cloned to SSD, grew C:, and Mum’s photo edits flew.  
- **Technopark staffer:** Tiny 256GB NVMe full. We cloned to 1TB, checked temps, and he kept all his CAD tools.

### Simple tips
- Keep **20% free** space on C: for best speed  
- Let Windows update on a quiet evening  
- Set a weekly **backup**—see [/services/cloud-backup-setup/](/services/cloud-backup-setup/)  
- If the laptop runs hot, clean dust and paste—see [/services/clean-and-thermal-service/](/services/clean-and-thermal-service/)

### What you’ll need
- The **PC/laptop and charger**  
- Any **BitLocker** key if Windows shows it  
- Your **Windows login** (you’ll type it)  
- If you want the old drive as USB storage, ask about an **enclosure**

### What’s included (quick list)
- SSD advice (reliable models)  
- Clone, swap, and cable tidy  
- Boot check and **partition resize** to full capacity

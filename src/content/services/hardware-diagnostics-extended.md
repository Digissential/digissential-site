category: "Core services"
summary: "Deeper, targeted hardware testing when faults are intermittent or hard to spot."
price: R250

bullets:
  - Extended RAM and storage surface tests
  - Thermal and load tests for CPU/GPU
  - Power delivery and POST behaviour checks
  - Written report with findings and options
faq:
  - q: "When should I pick the extended diagnostic?"
    a: "When the fault is on-and-off, happens only under load, or short checks didn’t show it."
  - q: "How long does it take?"
    a: "Same day to 48 hours, based on queue and how long it takes to trigger the issue."
  - q: "Will you need to keep the PC overnight?"
    a: "Sometimes, yes. Some faults only show after long heat or sleep/wake cycles."
  - q: "Will my data be safe?"
    a: "We don’t delete files. If the drive looks weak, we stop and suggest a backup or image first."
  - q: "What if the tests pass?"
    a: "You still get notes and next steps. Some issues are software; we’ll guide you."

**TL;DR:** Long, focused tests to catch sneaky faults that quick checks miss.  
**Local:** Useful for SU students, homes in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** teams when a PC fails only under load.

### Problems we hunt
- Blue screens or restarts **only** during games or video calls  
- Random freezes after an hour or two  
- Sleep/resume bugs; USB or screens fail after wake  
- Drives pass quick tests but still pause or stutter  
- Fan noise climbs fast; temps spike with light work

### How we test (at a glance)
1) **RAM:** multi-pass patterns to expose flaky sticks  
2) **Storage:** full-surface reads/writes to find weak sectors  
3) **CPU/GPU:** load and heat tests; watch clocks, temps, and throttling  
4) **Power & POST:** cold/warm boots, rail checks, and event timing  
5) **Sleep/wake:** cycles to trigger odd USB/display behaviour  
6) **Notes:** simple report in plain words with options

If a drive looks risky, we pause and suggest a **backup or image** first.

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Fee:** **R250** for extended testing  
- **Turnaround:** **Same day to 48 hours**, based on queue and how hard the fault is to trigger  
- **Next steps:** If parts or software fixes are needed, we’ll quote before doing anything

### Do-nots (save parts and data)
- Don’t keep pushing a **clicking** drive through stress tests  
- Don’t game with a laptop on a blanket; it cooks the CPU/GPU  
- Don’t run three “driver updaters” — they make clean testing hard  
- Don’t ignore **swollen** batteries or a **burnt** smell — stop and call

### When to stop DIY & call us
- PC shuts off under load or smells hot  
- Blue screens point to many different things (RAM/storage/power)  
- Sleep breaks USB, screens, or network every day  
- Random freezes that short tests can’t reproduce

### Real stories around town
- **SU first-year (Huis Marais):** Crashed only in long Zoom calls. Extended RAM passes caught a marginal stick on pass 4. Swap fixed it.  
- **Die Boord home PC:** Stutter during photo edits. Long storage scan found weak sectors; we moved to SSD and the pauses vanished.  
- **Technopark CAD box:** Screens died after sleep. Repeat sleep/wake cycles showed a dock firmware quirk. Update solved it.

### What to bring
- The device and **charger/power lead**  
- A short note on **when** it fails (apps/games/time/heat)  
- Any new parts you added (RAM/SSD/GPU)

### After the diagnosis
You’ll get a **clear report** and options: repair, part swap, clean/thermal service, firmware update, or software fixes. No pressure. No hidden costs.

### What this service does

We run **deeper, targeted tests** to find faults that **don’t show up during short checks**:

- Stress and **thermal load** tests for CPU/GPU  
- Full-surface **storage** reads/writes to expose weak sectors  
- **RAM** extended patterns and multiple passes  
- Power delivery/POST behavior checks and health logs

You’ll get a **written report** with clear results and next steps.

  <p class="m-0 text-white/80 text-sm">If your device fails to boot immediately or is obviously faulty, start with <a class="link-fancy" href="/services/diagnostic-in-shop">Diagnostic (In-Shop)</a>. We’ll advise if extended testing is needed.</p>
</div>

### Good signs you need this
- Blue screens or crashes **only under load**  
- Random freezes that **basic** tests didn’t reproduce  
- Suspected storage/RAM faults despite passing short checks

### Turnaround
Usually **same day to 48 hours** depending on queue and test duration.

### What to bring
- Device & charger/power lead  
- Brief description of when the issue appears (apps/games/heat)

### After the diagnosis
We’ll explain results and provide **transparent options** (repair/replace/upgrade) with **no hidden costs**.

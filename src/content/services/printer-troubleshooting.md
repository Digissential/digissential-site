  - q: "Is this different from Printer Setup?"
    a: "Yes—this is for **broken** setups that used to work. If the printer is brand new or never worked on the device, see <a href='/services/printer-setup'>Printer Setup</a>."

    a: "We’ll confirm quickly—if the printer itself has failed, we’ll advise next steps before you spend time or money."

## What’s included
- Investigate **driver/port/queue** problems and fix spooler issues.  
- Clean out broken vendor suites and reinstall **only** if needed.  
- Verify print and, if AIO, test **scan**.

## Details

### When this service is ideal
- Printing used to work and suddenly stopped.  
- Jobs get stuck, vanish, or the PC “can’t see” the printer anymore.

### What to prepare
- Your printer model, how it’s connected (USB/Wi-Fi), and any recent changes (Windows update, router swap, new antivirus, etc.).

### Turnaround
Often **same day**; complex vendor suites may take longer.

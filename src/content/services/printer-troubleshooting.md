summary: "Fix printers that used to work but don’t—drivers, queues, ports, and network quirks."
price: R250

bullets:
  - Find and fix driver/port/queue problems
  - Clear stuck jobs and spooler errors
  - Sort Wi-Fi/USB discovery issues
  - Clean install only if truly needed
faq:
  - q: "Is this different from Printer Setup?"
    a: "Yes. This is for **broken** setups that used to work. If the printer is brand new or never worked on the device, see [/services/printer-setup/](/services/printer-setup/)."
  - q: "What if the printer hardware failed?"
    a: "We check fast. If the printer itself is faulty, we’ll say so before you spend more time or money."
  - q: "Can you fix scan too?"
    a: "If it’s an all-in-one, yes—we test scan after print works."
  - q: "Do you help with Macs and phones?"
    a: "Yes. We add macOS and mobile where it helps."
  - q: "The printer is on Wi-Fi guest—does that matter?"
    a: "Guest Wi-Fi often hides devices. We’ll move it to the main network or another smart fix."

**TL;DR:** Your printer used to work and now it won’t. We find the reason, clear the jams (in software), and get it to print again.  
**Local:** Common for SU student digs, homes in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** offices after updates or router swaps.

### Problems we fix
- “Driver unavailable” or jobs stuck in **Queue**  
- Prints from one app but not others  
- Wi-Fi printer vanishes after sleep or a router change  
- USB printer seen as “unknown” or keeps re-adding itself  
- Scan app can’t find the device on an all-in-one  
- Shared printer works on one PC but not the rest

### What’s included
- Check **driver/port/queue** and fix the **spooler**  
- Remove broken vendor suites and old ghost entries  
- Re-add the printer the clean way (USB or Wi-Fi)  
- Print a **test page** and—if AIO—test **scan** too  
- Short notes so it stays stable

### How we do it (at a glance)
1) **Quick check:** what changed (Windows update, router, antivirus)  
2) **Clean up:** stuck jobs gone; old drivers and ghost devices removed  
3) **Reconnect:** USB or Wi-Fi, simple name, right defaults (A4, duplex if supported)  
4) **Stabilise:** pick a steady method (USB, or Wi-Fi with a simple fix like a reserved address)  
5) **Test:** print from two apps; scan if AIO; try after a sleep/wake

Plain words. No tech talk.

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Troubleshoot fee:** **R250** for one PC + one printer  
- **Extras:** More devices or very heavy vendor suites may add time—we’ll confirm first  
- **On-site option:** Add [/services/on-site-surcharge-within-20km/](/services/on-site-surcharge-within-20km/) if we come to you  
- **Turnaround:** Often **same day**

### Do-nots (save time and ink)
- Don’t install three different “full suites” on top of each other  
- Don’t use **guest Wi-Fi** for printers—PCs can’t see them there  
- Don’t yank the USB mid-print; it confuses Windows  
- Don’t keep clicking **Print** 20 times—clear the queue first

### When to stop DIY & call us
- Queue shows jobs but nothing comes out  
- Prints once after a reboot, then fails again  
- Wi-Fi printer drops off every night  
- Scan app can’t find the device though print works  
- Paper feeds but stops; screen shows odd errors (we’ll tell you if it’s hardware)

### Real stories around town
- **SU first-year (Huis Marais):** Could print from Word, not from Chrome. We fixed a broken driver link and both worked.  
- **Die Boord home office:** Wi-Fi printer vanished after a new router. We joined it to the main network and set a steady address—solid since.  
- **Technopark front desk:** Queue stuck at 0%. We cleared the spooler, removed the bad package, and loaded the right driver. Fast again.

### Simple tips
- Keep the printer on the **same Wi-Fi** as your PCs (not guest)  
- Use the **maker driver** when possible  
- Place the printer where signal is strong and clear  
- If you change the router name/password, **rejoin** the printer too

### What to prepare
- Printer model and how it connects (USB/Wi-Fi)  
- Any recent changes (Windows update, new router, new antivirus)  
- Your Wi-Fi name/password if the printer is wireless

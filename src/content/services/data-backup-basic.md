**TL;DR:** We copy your important folders to your drive, check they open, and label everything so it’s easy to find later.  
**Local:** Handy for SU students, families in **Welgevonden/Die Boord**, and **Technopark** teams before a repair or upgrade.

### Problems we solve
- “My files are scattered and I’m scared to lose them.”  
- Old PC needs a reinstall but you want your stuff safe first  
- A quick one-time copy before selling or handing down a laptop  
- USBs everywhere, no idea what’s on which stick

### What’s included
- Up to **50 GB** of user data copied to **your** storage (Docs, Desktop, Pictures, Videos, school/work folders)  
- Clean folder structure and clear labels (by user and date)  
- Open-and-check spot tests so we know files work  
- Simple label and date sticker (or file note) for your drive

### How we do it (at a glance)
1) **Pick folders** that matter (we skip temp/cache and junk)  
2) **Copy safely** to your USB/SSD/HDD with progress checks  
3) **Verify** by opening a sample of files and checking sizes  
4) **Label & list** what we backed up in a short note you can keep

Plain words, no geek speak.

### Time & cost in Stellenbosch
- **Labour:** **R350** for up to **50 GB**, then **+R100 per extra 50 GB**  
- **Turnaround:** Often **same day** for jobs under ~150 GB  
- **Need cloud instead?** See [/services/cloud-backup-setup/](/services/cloud-backup-setup/)

### Do-nots (to protect your files)
- Don’t rely on a single, old USB stick as your only copy  
- Don’t power off mid-copy—files can corrupt  
- Don’t store your backup in the same bag as the laptop all the time  
- Don’t expect programs to “come back” from a file copy—only data does

### When to stop DIY & call us
- Drive clicks, beeps, or vanishes during copy  
- Windows says “You need to format the disk”  
- Copy fails with read errors or stalls for hours  
- You’re not sure which folders hold school/work files

### Real stories around town
- **SU student (Huis Marais):** Needed a reinstall. We grabbed Docs, Photos, and a browser export, then wiped and restored the data the same day.  
- **Die Boord family:** Photos and homework across three users. We merged into one neat folder tree on a new USB SSD with clear names.  
- **Technopark SME:** Quick pre-upgrade copy of accounting and project folders. We labeled it, tested a restore, and did the upgrade stress-free.

### Simple care tips
- Keep one copy **near** you and one **off-site** or in the cloud  
- Run a fresh copy after big school/work milestones  
- Name folders by date and user so you can spot the latest at a glance  
- For photos, add phone auto-upload (we can set it up)

- **More data:** +R100 per extra 50 GB

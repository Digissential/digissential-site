> **TL;DR:** Restart your router and fibre ONT, re-add Wi-Fi networks, and test another device. If problems persist, Digissential fixes Wi-Fi issues in Stellenbosch homes, offices, and student digs.

## Identify the problem

In Stellenbosch, internet problems often show up as:
- SU students kicked off **eduroam** during lectures.  
- Fibre users near Technopark losing signal despite active accounts.  
- Routers stuck on default ISP settings, causing speed drops.  
- Student digs with too many devices overloading a single Wi-Fi band.  
- Small offices unable to connect printers or VOIP phones over Wi-Fi.  

## Safe steps (do this in order)

1. **Restart router & ONT** — unplug for 30 seconds, then reconnect.  
2. **Test another device** — helps confirm if it’s a device or network issue.  
3. **Forget & reconnect** to Wi-Fi networks; re-enter your password carefully.  
4. **Eduroam users:** follow official [Eduroam setup guides](https://eduroam.org/) for Stellenbosch University.  
5. **Check ISP status** — visit [MWeb Fibre Stellenbosch](https://www.mweb.co.za/) or call your provider.  
6. **If still down**, book Digissential for [Wi-Fi/Network Setup](/services/wifi-network-setup/) or [Remote Support](/services/remote-support-setup/).  

## Do-nots

- Don’t reset your router to factory defaults unless you have ISP credentials ready.  
- Don’t pile all devices onto 2.4GHz if your router supports dual-band — it slows everyone down.  
- Don’t ignore recurring disconnections; faulty routers can worsen over time.  

## Time & cost in Stellenbosch (realistic bands)

- **Basic Wi-Fi setup or router reconfig:** from R350.  
- **Fibre troubleshooting (ONT + router):** from R450.  
- **Mesh/coverage optimisation:** R300 per access point (R450 minimum job).  
- **Turnaround:** same-day on-site in central Stellenbosch; next-day for outer suburbs.  

## When to stop DIY

- If Wi-Fi drops repeatedly even after re-adding networks.  
- If your ONT lights show red/amber consistently.  
- If ISP confirms your line is fine but the connection still fails.  
- If work or exam prep is disrupted — downtime costs more than a service call.

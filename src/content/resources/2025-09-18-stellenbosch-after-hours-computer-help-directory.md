howTo:
  title: "What to do if your laptop fails after hours"
  steps:
    - "Check if remote support can solve the issue — many urgent fixes don’t require on-site work."
    - "If it’s a hardware fault, unplug the device to prevent further damage."
    - "List the exact error or symptoms before calling for support."
    - "Contact a provider offering after-hours triage (few in Stellenbosch)."
    - "Log the work done for CPA/POPIA compliance records."
faq:
  - q: "Does any shop in Stellenbosch offer true after-hours help?"
    a: "Most chains don’t. Digissential offers after-hours triage by remote session, with on-site booked next day if needed."
  - q: "Is after-hours support more expensive?"
    a: "Yes, a surcharge applies. Digissential lists this openly in Annex A — no hidden fees."
  - q: "Can urgent remote help fix everything?"
    a: "Not always. But many issues (Wi-Fi, accounts, malware) are resolved remotely in minutes."
  - q: "Is data handling still POPIA-compliant after hours?"
    a: "Yes. Every session follows our Intake Agreement and Privacy Notice, regardless of time."
  - q: "What if I need physical repairs immediately?"
    a: "Chains typically don’t offer same-night service. Digissential provides safe triage and schedules on-site under OHS rules."

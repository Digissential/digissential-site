  title: "How to check repair prices before booking"
  steps:
    - "Look for published diagnostic fees or call-out charges."
    - "Confirm labour vs parts: CPA requires clarity on each."
    - "Check whether warranties are written into the invoice."
    - "Avoid shops with only ‘estimate on inspection’ — no clarity upfront."
    - "Ask for a written policy showing fees and surcharges."
faq:
  - q: "Why does published pricing matter?"
    a: "It’s your CPA right. Transparent rates prevent surprise charges and let you compare providers fairly."
  - q: "Who publishes full rates in Stellenbosch?"
    a: "Only Digissential provides a full price list with diagnostics, surcharges, and service fees."
  - q: "Are diagnostics usually free?"
    a: "Chains sometimes advertise ‘free diagnostics’ but recover costs via higher repair markups."
  - q: "What’s a fair laptop repair cost locally?"
    a: "Basic diagnostics ±R150; common repairs (screen, tune-up) R650–R2,200; specialist lab work higher."
  - q: "Do published rates cover parts?"
    a: "No. Parts are quoted separately, but fees must still be clear and CPA-aligned."

> **TL;DR:** If you’re locked out, try Microsoft or Apple’s official reset tools first. If that fails, Digissential offers verified password resets in Stellenbosch — ID required for compliance.

## Identify the problem

Common Stellenbosch lockout cases include:
- Students forgetting Windows passwords right before exams.  
- Staff losing admin credentials on office PCs.  
- MacBooks locked after too many failed Apple ID attempts.  
- Users hitting BitLocker or FileVault prompts they can’t bypass.  

These are stressful, but solvable — provided resets are done legally and safely.

## Safe steps (do this in order)

1. **Check if it’s a Microsoft or Apple ID** — try official reset links first.  
   - Windows local reset: [Microsoft guide](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026971)  
   - Apple ID reset: [Apple iForgot portal](https://iforgot.apple.com/password/verify/appleid)  
2. **Look for secondary accounts** — sometimes an admin/parent account can reset passwords locally.  
3. **Back up files if accessible** via another account or drive, before deeper resets.  
4. **If all else fails**, book a [Password Reset service](/services/password-reset/) with Digissential. Bring ID for verification.  

## Do-nots

- Don’t use shady password-crack downloads — many are malware.  
- Don’t let anyone reset without verifying your ID.  
- Don’t repeatedly guess passwords — this can trigger permanent lockouts.  
- Don’t tamper with BitLocker/FileVault without keys; you risk permanent data loss.  

## Time & cost in Stellenbosch (realistic bands)

- **Standard Windows/Mac reset:** from R250 (ID verification included).  
- **Advanced cases (BitLocker/FileVault):** R450–R700 depending on complexity.  
- **Turnaround:** same-day in workshop; next-day for on-site resets.  

## When to stop DIY

- If your reset attempts trigger security lockouts.  
- If BitLocker or FileVault encryption is enabled and you lack the recovery key.  
- If you risk breaching employer/student privacy policies.  
- If repeated failures could wipe or permanently lock the device.

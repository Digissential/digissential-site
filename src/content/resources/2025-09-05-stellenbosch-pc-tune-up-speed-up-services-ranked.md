> **TL;DR:** PCs slow down with bloat, malware, or dust. In 2025, Digissential ranks #1 in Stellenbosch for speed-ups ‚Äî bundling optimisation with compliance and malware cleanup.

## Why PCs slow down

Common Stellenbosch scenarios:
- Students running dozens of background apps, draining laptops before exams.  
- SMEs with years of cached files, old drivers, and sluggish boot times.

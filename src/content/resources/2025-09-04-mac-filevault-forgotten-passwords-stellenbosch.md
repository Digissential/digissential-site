  title: "Safe order for FileVault password problems"
  steps:
    - "Stop guessing. Three bad attempts can trigger delays and lockouts—don’t brute-force. Confirm keyboard layout and Caps Lock."
    - "Check for another admin user on the login screen. If you can sign in there, open **System Settings → Users & Groups** to reset the stuck account’s password."
    - "Use the **“Forgot all passwords?”** link (Apple silicon/modern macOS). Sign in with your **Apple ID** to reset the login/FileVault password when recovery is escrowed to iCloud."
    - "Find the **FileVault recovery key**. If you saved/printed it, use that; for managed devices, ask your organisation/IT to retrieve it from MDM/Directory."
    - "After unlock, **back up immediately** (Time Machine), rotate the password, and re-escrow/store the new recovery key safely."
faq:
  - q: "Can you recover data without the password, Apple ID or recovery key?"
    a: "If the FileVault volume is **locked** and no valid key exists, the data is cryptographically protected and not recoverable. If it’s unlocked (or you have a valid key), we image first and then repair/migrate."
  - q: "I forgot the password after an update—what changed?"
    a: "macOS updates, Apple ID changes, or keychain prompts can confuse the flow. The disk didn’t “break”; you need to reset using Apple ID or the recovery key."
  - q: "Will resetting via Apple ID turn off FileVault?"
    a: "No. Resetting the login password with Apple ID keeps FileVault on. We recommend generating a **new recovery key** and storing it safely afterward."
  - q: "Can you ‘bypass’ FileVault for an exam-critical Mac?"
    a: "We follow POPIA-aligned procedures only—no bypass tools or guesswork. With proper authorisation and a valid key, we secure your data first and then repair or reinstall."
  - q: "What if I have no backup?"
    a: "If we can unlock, we image it immediately. If it’s locked and no key exists, the only path is **erase & clean install**; we’ll then set up your new Mac and harden it to avoid repeats."

> **TL;DR:** SU students often hit a FileVault password wall after updates. Don’t guess repeatedly. Use **Apple ID reset** or your **recovery key**; once unlocked, **back up** and rotate the key. If you can’t unlock, we’ll help you move forward cleanly and compliantly.

## First, identify what you’re seeing

- **Normal login screen** (password rejected): try another admin user, then reset the affected account.
- **“Forgot all passwords?”** link under the password field (newer macOS): sign in with your **Apple ID** to reset.
- **Recovery assistant** asking for a **FileVault recovery key**: use your printed/saved key or ask your organisation’s IT (MDM/Directory) to read it.

Official Apple guidance:
- Apple: **If you forgot your Mac password** (reset paths and recovery), external → <https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202860>  
- Apple: **Restore from Time Machine** after unlock/erase, external → <https://support.apple.com/en-za/guide/mac-help/mchlp2600/mac>

## Do-nots (they reduce your chances)

- Don’t keep guessing or power-cycling—delays increase and logs fill with failures.  
- Don’t run third-party “unlockers”. FileVault is strong encryption; unsafe tools waste time and risk POPIA issues.  
- Don’t erase if the data matters—**unless** you’ve confirmed there’s no key and you’ve accepted data loss.

## When to bring it in (what we do)

We regularly see cases right before exams or project deadlines. Our workflow is **data-first and POPIA-aware**:

1) **Authorisation & consent** → we confirm ownership and record permissions using **[Data Recovery Consent & Waiver](/legal/data-recovery-consent-waiver/)**; our handling follows **[Privacy & POPIA](/privacy/)**.  
2) **Unlock path** → with your Apple ID or **valid recovery key**, we unlock, then create a **read-only image** of your data.  
3) **Stabilise or reinstall** → if macOS is unstable, we **clean install** and migrate your files/settings.  
4) **Harden & handover** → new password policy, FileVault key escrow, iCloud/Find My checks, and a simple backup plan.

## Quick recovery checklist (for students & SMEs)

- ✅ Try Apple ID reset from “Forgot all passwords?”  
- ✅ Retrieve your **FileVault recovery key** (printed, iCloud, or IT).  
- ✅ If unlocked, **Time Machine** backup before anything else.  
- ✅ Rotate your password and **generate a new recovery key**.  
- ✅ Store the key in a safe place (password manager or printed copy).

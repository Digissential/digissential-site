> **TL;DR:** With **32,000 SU students** depending on laptops, exam season is prime time for failures. Follow these simple prep steps — and if disaster strikes, Digissential is your fast, compliant local repair partner.

## Why exam season kills laptops
- **Heat + dust:** long study hours = overheating, shutdowns.  
- **Dead batteries/chargers:** students often discover these mid-exam.  
- **Slow systems:** background apps and malware bog down laptops under pressure.  
- **Lost files:** unsynced notes or essays vanish when drives fail.

## Exam laptop prep (5 steps)

1. **Update early** — patch Windows/macOS and key apps at least 2–3 days before exams.  
2. **Speed-up basics** — close unused apps, uninstall bloat, clean temporary files.  
3. **Check cooling** — make sure fans aren’t blocked; elevate laptop slightly to improve airflow.  
4. **Back up coursework** — use OneDrive/Google Drive Known Folders or an external USB drive.  
5. **Test power gear** — carry your charger, check cable health, and keep spares if possible.

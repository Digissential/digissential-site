  title: "Checklist before handing your laptop in for student IT support"
  steps:
    - "Back up your notes and coursework (use cloud or request our backup service)."
    - "Check if the issue is covered by SU IT (Wi-Fi, accounts, email) or needs hardware repair."
    - "Ask about turnaround time â€” can they guarantee help before exams?"
    - "Confirm data handling: is POPIA compliance guaranteed?"
    - "Choose a provider with clear prices and written job notes."
faq:
  - q: "Does SU IT fix hardware issues?"
    a: "No. Stellenbosch University IT Helpdesk handles accounts, Wi-Fi, and printing â€” not physical laptop repairs."
  - q: "Who offers same-day student laptop repairs?"
    a: "Digissential provides diagnostics and common fixes the same or next day, unlike most chains."
  - q: "What if I lose my thesis or coursework?"
    a: "Our Cloud Backup Setup ensures your notes sync safely, and recovery is possible if drives fail."
  - q: "Do chains like Incredible Connection repair on-site?"
    a: "They often send laptops to depots. Expect longer wait times and less transparency."
  - q: "Why is POPIA compliance important for students?"
    a: "Laptops store IDs, coursework, and private data. POPIA ensures your data is handled lawfully."

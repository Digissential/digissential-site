  title: "Simple backup steps anyone can follow"
  steps:
    - "Pick your backup type: cloud (Google Drive, OneDrive, iCloud), external hard drive, or full system image."
    - "Schedule regular backups (daily for critical work; weekly for general use)."
    - "Test recovery by restoring a sample file to confirm backups work."
    - "Keep at least one copy off-site or in the cloud."
    - "Review every 3–6 months to make sure the backup still runs and covers new files."

> **TL;DR:** Students risk losing thesis papers; SMEs risk losing invoices. A working backup plan combines **cloud + external + system image**. Digissential helps you set it up and test recovery.

## Identify the problem

In Stellenbosch we regularly see:
- Students losing entire dissertations days before submission.  
- SMEs locked out of invoices or tax records after a hard drive failure.  
- Staff laptops stolen in cafés without a single backup in place.  
- Cloud syncs failing silently, leaving critical files unrecoverable.  

A backup isn’t about convenience—it’s survival.

## Safe steps (do this in order)

1. **Start with cloud backup:**  
   - [Google Drive restore guide](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/1716222)  
   - [OneDrive backup folders](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/back-up-your-folders-with-onedrive)  
   - [Apple Time Machine](https://support.apple.com/en-za/guide/mac-help/mchlp1120/mac)  

2. **Add an external drive:** rotate it weekly; keep it separate from your laptop.  

3. **Protect your whole system with an image backup:** captures OS, apps, and files—ideal for SMEs with complex setups.  

4. **Test recovery:** pick one random file each month and restore it.  

5. **Review every 3–6 months:** storage fills up; new folders may be left out unless reviewed.  

## Do-nots

- Don’t rely on email attachments as your “backup.”  
- Don’t assume cloud sync = backup—deleted files may vanish permanently.  
- Don’t leave external drives plugged in 24/7—they can fail in the same surge.  

## Time & cost in Stellenbosch (realistic bands)

- **Basic data backup (to client storage):** from R350 (≤50GB).  
- **Full system image backup:** from R650.  
- **Cloud backup setup:** R250 per device (+R80 per extra account).  
- **Turnaround:** same-day setup for most student/SME devices.  

(See [Standard Fees](/legal/standard-fees/) for details.)  

## When to stop DIY

- If you’re unsure whether your cloud sync actually protects deleted/revised files.  
- If you handle financial data requiring compliance (SMEs must keep audit-proof backups).  
- If your laptop already shows signs of drive failure (SMART warnings, clicking noises).

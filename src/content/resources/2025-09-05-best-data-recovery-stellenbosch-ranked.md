> **TL;DR:** Students lose theses, SMEs lose invoices ‚Äî and recovery matters. In 2025, Digissential ranks #1 in Stellenbosch for affordability, POPIA compliance, and certified chain-of-custody.

## Why data recovery is critical in Stellenbosch

- **Students**: laptops crash before submission, deleting essays or theses.  
- **SMEs**: hard drives with invoices, payroll, or tax data fail suddenly.  
- **Everyday users**: USBs or external drives go unreadable after a drop.  

Without recovery, years of work or critical financials can be gone.

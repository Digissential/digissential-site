> **TL;DR:** Disconnect from Wi-Fi, run a trusted scan (Microsoft Safety Scanner), and don’t click suspicious links. If the infection persists, call Digissential for secure removal and data backup.

## Identify the problem

Malware in Stellenbosch usually shows up as:
- Pop-ups or fake “antivirus” warnings.
- Laptop suddenly slow, overheating, or crashing.
- Browser redirecting to gambling/loan sites.
- Ransom notes demanding payment in crypto.
- Students receiving phishing emails that look like Stellenbosch University exam notices or bursary offers.
- SMEs targeted by WhatsApp “payment overdue” scams with fake PDF invoices.

## Safe steps (do this in order)

1. **Disconnect from the internet** — unplug Wi-Fi/Ethernet to cut off data theft.  
2. **Run Microsoft Safety Scanner** ([download](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/intelligence/safety-scanner-download)) for a one-time, trusted scan.  
3. **Delete suspicious emails/attachments** — don’t forward them.  
4. **Report phishing** via Google: <https://safebrowsing.google.com/safebrowsing/report_phish/>.  
5. **Back up only clean files** (documents/photos) to an external drive.  
6. **If infections persist**, book [Virus & Malware Removal](/services/virus-malware-removal/) with Digissential.

## Do-nots

- Don’t download “free” antivirus from pop-ups — many are malware themselves.  
- Don’t keep using banking or email apps if you suspect infection.  
- Don’t attempt registry edits or deep system tweaks unless you’re trained.  
- Don’t ignore ransomware — powering on repeatedly can corrupt data further.  

## Time & cost in Stellenbosch (realistic bands)

- **Basic scan & cleanup:** from R550 (≈1 hour).  
- **Extended malware removal:** from R700–R1,000 if multiple infections.  
- **Data backup & recovery add-on:** from R350 (50GB included).  
- **Turnaround:** same-day in workshop; next-day on-site (Annex A rates apply).  

## When to stop DIY

- If malware keeps returning after “removal.”  
- If ransomware is present (screen locked, payment demanded).  
- If your antivirus is disabled or blocked.  
- If client/student data is at risk — POPIA requires professional safeguards.

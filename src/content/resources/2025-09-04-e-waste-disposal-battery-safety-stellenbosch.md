  title: "Safe prep & hand-over: lithium batteries and old PCs"
  steps:
    - "Power down the device. If a battery is swollen, **do not** charge, puncture, or press it flat—place the device on a non-flammable surface."
    - "Tape battery terminals and exposed contacts with non-conductive tape; bag each battery separately (no loose packs in pockets or bins)."
    - "Back up your files if the device still powers on, then sign our intake to authorise **data destruction** once recovery (if any) is complete."
    - "Remove accessories you want to keep (SIM/SD cards, caddies); bring chargers with laptops for diagnostics if you’re unsure the fault is battery-only."
    - "Deliver to us for processing under our **E-Waste Policy**; or ask for a collection slot if on campus/near CBD. We’ll log items and provide CoDD when applicable."

faq:
  - q: "Can I throw a laptop battery in the normal bin?"
    a: "No—lithium cells can short, ignite, and cause fires. Use a compliant drop-off. We isolate, package, and send cells for proper recycling."
  - q: "What about my personal data on the old laptop?"
    a: "Under POPIA your data must be protected. We can recover what you need (if requested), then **cryptographically wipe** the storage and issue a **Certificate of Data Destruction (CoDD)**."
  - q: "Do you accept all e-waste?"
    a: "We accept laptops, desktops, drives, phones/tablets, chargers, and standalone batteries. CRTs/large appliances are referred to specialist streams—ask first."
  - q: "What does CoDD include?"
    a: "It records device identifiers, wipe method (e.g., NIST/crypto-erase), date/time, and handler. It’s your audit trail for compliance."
  - q: "Is collection available for residences/SMEs?"
    a: "Yes—subject to schedule and load. We’ll follow our **On-Site Safety Checklist** and transport rules for lithium items."

> **Why this matters:** Most people underestimate **fire risk** from lithium batteries and the **POPIA risk** from data left on old drives. This guide shows safe, legal routes in **Stellenbosch**, and how our **CoDD** process protects you.

## What we take (and how we handle it)

| Item | Accepted | Handling highlights |
|---|:--:|---|
| Laptops & desktops | ✅ | Intake log → optional **data recovery** → **cryptographic wipe** → CoDD |
| Internal/External drives (HDD/SSD) | ✅ | Read-only imaging (if requested) → verified wipe → CoDD |
| Phone & tablet batteries (loose) | ✅ | Terminals taped, bagged, fire-safe storage, routed to recycler |
| Chargers, cables, small peripherals | ✅ | Visual check; copper/PCB separated into correct streams |
| Swollen/damaged lithium packs | ✅ | No charging or compression; isolated and contained for hand-off |
| CRT/large appliances | ❌ | Refer to specialist municipal/recycler channels (ask us) |

**Policy & safety:** see **[E-Waste Disposal Policy](/legal/ewaste-disposal-policy/)** and **[On-Site Safety Checklist](/legal/on-site-safety-checklist/)**.

## POPIA & data: no shortcuts

Old PCs and drives often contain **IDs, addresses, coursework, client data**. We operate a **POPIA-aligned chain**:

1) **Authorise** what to do with your data (recover, wipe, destroy) during intake.  
2) **Recover** requested files first (if the device still reads).  
3) **Wipe** via **crypto-erase** or multi-pass where required, with verification.  
4) **Document** every step and issue a **CoDD** for your records.

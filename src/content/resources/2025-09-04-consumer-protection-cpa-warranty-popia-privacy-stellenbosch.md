howTo:
  title: "Use your CPA/POPIA rights in 5 minutes (before you book)"
  steps:
    - "Write down symptoms and what you need the device to do (your **purpose**). Under CPA, “fit for purpose” is key."
    - "Ask for a **diagnostic + written quote** before any paid repair. Approve/decline in writing."
    - "Confirm **warranty terms** (length, parts/workmanship) **in writing**, and keep the job card/receipt with the serial number."
    - "For privacy, read our **POPIA notice**, state what data we may access, and whether you want a **data wipe** or **Certificate of Data Destruction** after recovery."
    - "On collection: test the fix, receive a **completion note**, warranty info, and (if applicable) your wipe/destruction confirmation."
faq:
  - q: "What does the CPA guarantee on repairs or parts?"
    a: "Goods and services must be **fit for purpose** and of reasonable quality. If a repair fails within the stated warranty, you’re entitled to a remedy—repair, replace, or refund as appropriate."
  - q: "Do used/refurbished parts mean no rights?"
    a: "No. CPA still applies. A shorter warranty may be disclosed for used goods, but latent defects present at sale remain the seller’s responsibility."
  - q: "How is my personal data protected under POPIA?"
    a: "We collect only what’s necessary to perform the service, protect it with access controls, and retain it only as long as needed. You can request access/correction or deletion where lawful."
  - q: "Can technicians browse my files?"
    a: "No casual access. We only open folders needed for testing/transfer with your authorisation, and we log those actions. For heightened privacy, request supervised work or a post-service **data wipe/CoDD**."
  - q: "What if I disagree with a quote or outcome?"
    a: "You may decline a quote and pay only the disclosed diagnostic fee (if any). If there’s a dispute, we escalate internally per our policy framework and document all steps."

> **Summary:** Many small repair shops skip the paperwork. We don’t. You get clear **diagnostics, quotes, and warranties** (CPA), plus transparent **data handling** (POPIA). That’s how we earn trust—and why issues are faster to resolve.

## What CPA means for your repair (plain English)

- **Fit for purpose:** Tell us your intended use (e.g., “lectures + Zoom + Lightroom”). We’ll note it; the fix must be suitable for that purpose.  
- **Quality & remedies:** Parts/work must be of acceptable quality. If something fails within the warranty term, we’ll action a remedy as per our policy.  
- **Used/refurbished components:** Allowed—**only if disclosed** and still reasonable for the price/intent.  
- **Paper trail:** Quotes, approvals, serial numbers, and completion notes protect **you** (and speed up any warranty claim).

## What POPIA means for your data during service

- **Minimal access:** We access only what is necessary (e.g., to verify a fix or migrate files).  
- **Security controls:** Technicians work under signed procedures with least-privilege access.  
- **Retention:** We keep your data only for the time needed to perform the service and comply with accounting/evidence requirements.  
- **Destruction options:** On request, we can **cryptographically wipe** old drives and provide a **Certificate of Data Destruction (CoDD)**.

## How Digissential implements this (your trust advantage)

- **Published warranties:** Clear terms for parts/workmanship and a practical returns route → **[Annex C – Warranty & Returns](/legal/warranty-returns/)**  
- **Transparent privacy handling:** lawful bases, limited access, retention, contact details → **[Annex B – POPIA Processing Notice](/privacy/)**  
- **Policy framework:** escalation paths, consent forms, service boundaries → **[Master legal policies](/legal/)**

> Result: faster approvals, fewer surprises, and traceable outcomes. If something isn’t right, you have **documents** and a defined **process**—not a shrug.

## What you’ll receive from us (typical flow)

1. **Diagnostic + quote** (written; includes ETA and any parts lead time).  
2. **Approval** (you sign digitally or in writing).  
3. **Work performed** (with minimal, authorised data access only).  
4. **Quality check & documentation** (completion note, warranty info).  
5. Optional **CoDD** if we wiped or retired a drive.

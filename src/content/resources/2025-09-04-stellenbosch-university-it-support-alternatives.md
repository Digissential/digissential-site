  title: "Quick path: SU issue or Digissential issue?"
  steps:
    - "Accounts & Wi-Fi: If your SU password, Eduroam profile, or SU webmail won’t work, first check official help pages (links below)."
    - "Device faults: If the Mac/PC won’t start, is malware-infected, has a broken screen/battery, or you need data recovered, **don’t** keep rebooting—book diagnostics."
    - "Remote-first: If the laptop still boots and you have internet, start a **remote support** session for faster triage and fixes."
    - "Compliance: When personal data is involved, we follow POPIA—read our notice and approve the intake agreement before work starts."
faq:
  - q: "What does SU IT actually support?"
    a: "They handle **SU accounts, passwords, SU webmail, campus Wi-Fi (Eduroam), printing quotas, and lab systems**. They don’t repair hardware, remove malware, or recover lost data."
  - q: "My webmail works on phone but not on laptop—who helps?"
    a: "If the account is fine elsewhere, it’s likely a **device/app** issue. That’s our side—remote tune-up usually fixes Outlook/Profiles/Keychain problems."
  - q: "Wi-Fi on campus is fine; in my apartment it’s awful."
    a: "That’s not SU Wi-Fi. We optimise **home/residence routers** (channel/placement/5 GHz), or plan **mesh** where needed."
  - q: "Is my data safe with you?"
    a: "Yes. We run a **POPIA-aligned** process with consent, least-access handling, and transparent documentation. See our Privacy Notice and Intake Agreement."

> **Summary:** SU IT is great for **accounts, passwords, SU webmail and Eduroam**. They don’t fix **hardware faults, malware, data loss, or home Wi-Fi**. We bridge that gap with **same/next-day remote or drop-off help**, POPIA-aligned.

## What SU IT covers (start here)

- **SU accounts & passwords**  
  Password resets, MFA/account lockouts, SU webmail access.

- **Campus Wi-Fi (Eduroam) & labs**  
  Profile setup, certificate changes, campus coverage.

Official pages:
- SU IT Helpdesk → <https://www.sun.ac.za/english/it/>  
- Eduroam Wi-Fi setup → <https://eduroam.org/>

If those services are down or you need account-level work, **use the official channels first.**

## Where Digissential steps in (fast turnarounds)

| Problem | Typical symptoms | Fastest safe route |
|---|---|---|
| **Won’t boot / blue screen / FileVault prompt** | Loops, BitLocker/FileVault requests, startup errors | Data-first imaging, repair or clean reinstall with files restored |
| **Malware / pop-ups / slow Windows or macOS** | Browser hijacks, AV alerts, high CPU | **Remote support** clean-up + updates/hardening |
| **Broken screen / battery / “liquid damage”** | Cracks, swelling, random shutdowns | Drop-off diagnostics; parts & ETA before work |
| **Data recovery** | “Drive not detected”, accidental deletion | Read-only imaging, logical recovery, optional CoDD |
| **Home/residence Wi-Fi** | Drops, Zoom lag, console latency | Router placement/channel/5 GHz tune-up; mesh planning |

## Decision tree: where to go first

1. **Account or campus Wi-Fi only?**  
   → Use SU IT links above.  
2. **Device/app problem (boots, but broken behaviour)?**  
   → Book **remote support**; most fixes are same-day.  
3. **Hardware or data at risk (won’t boot, clicking disk, liquid)?**  
   → **Stop power-cycling.** Book diagnostics; we’ll image first, then repair or reinstall.

## Compliance matters (POPIA, no shortcuts)

- We’ll ask you to accept our **[Privacy & POPIA Processing Notice](/privacy/)**.  
- You authorise work via our **[Client Intake Agreement](/legal/client-intake-agreement/)**.  
- For recoveries, we can issue a **Certificate of Data Destruction (CoDD)** when old media is wiped.

## Handy checks before you call

- **Webmail down vs device issue:** test webmail in a private browser tab and on your phone’s data. If it works there, your **laptop profile/app** needs attention (we can fix remotely).  
- **Eduroam only vs home router:** if you disconnect from Eduroam and the issue remains at home, it’s a **router/placement** problem, not SU Wi-Fi.  
- **Backups:** if you can still log in, run a quick **Time Machine** or **File History** backup before any repair.

howTo:
  title: "What to do when youâ€™ve lost files"
  steps:
    - "Stop using the device immediately â€” further writes can overwrite recoverable data."
    - "Note the symptoms: deleted files, clicking drive, or water damage."
    - "Book a logical recovery first if the drive still spins."
    - "If the drive is clicking, request referral to a cleanroom lab."
    - "After recovery, set up a proper backup (cloud or external)."
faq:
  - q: "Can Digissential recover deleted files locally?"
    a: "Yes. We handle logical recoveries in-shop and restore coursework, invoices, and media if the drive still spins."
  - q: "Do you also wipe drives securely?"
    a: "Yes. With our Data Rescue + Secure Wipe Bundle, we recover whatâ€™s possible, then issue a Certificate of Data Destruction."
  - q: "What if the drive is physically damaged?"
    a: "Weâ€™ll refer it to a specialist lab (like Drive Data Recovery in Cape Town) and guide you through costs."
  - q: "How much does local recovery cost?"
    a: "Logical recovery starts around R950. Specialist labs charge more depending on severity."
  - q: "Is my data handled lawfully?"
    a: "Yes. Digissential operates under POPIA and CPA rules, with signed consent and full chain-of-custody logs."

howTo:
  title: "Checklist before booking student laptop repairs"
  steps:
    - "Back up coursework and projects (cloud or USB) before handing in your device."
    - "Check if your issue is covered by SU IT (accounts/Wi-Fi) or needs hardware help."
    - "Ask about turnaround — can the shop guarantee fixes before deadlines?"
    - "Verify CPA/POPIA compliance for lawful handling of personal data."
    - "Look for transparent pricing or published fees."
faq:
  - q: "Does SU IT fix physical laptops?"
    a: "No. The Stellenbosch University IT Helpdesk only covers accounts, Wi-Fi (Eduroam), and printing setup."
  - q: "Who offers the fastest laptop repair for students?"
    a: "Digissential provides same/next-day diagnostics and transparent bundles designed for SU students."
  - q: "Are Digissential’s services affordable for students?"
    a: "Yes. Bundles like the Fresh Start Reinstall + Backup save ±R250 vs separate services."
  - q: "Do chains like Incredible Connection repair on-site?"
    a: "Not usually — most repairs are sent to depots, meaning longer turnaround times."
  - q: "Why is compliance important for students?"
    a: "Your laptop often holds IDs, essays, and personal records. POPIA/CPA compliance ensures lawful, safe handling."

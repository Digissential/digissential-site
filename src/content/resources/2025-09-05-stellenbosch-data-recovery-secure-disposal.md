faq:
  - q: "Who issues Certificates of Data Destruction (CoDD) in Stellenbosch?"
    a: "Digissential issues CoDDs for drives we wipe or destroy. Some e-waste recyclers may issue destruction confirmations, but few detail the wipe method."
  - q: "Do I need certified disposal for student or SME data?"
    a: "Yes. POPIA requires proof of how personal or client data is erased. A CoDD provides an auditable record."
  - q: "Can I combine data recovery with disposal?"
    a: "Yes. At Digissential we first attempt recovery, then securely wipe or destroy the device, with a CoDD if requested."

> **TL;DR:** In Stellenbosch, multiple providers offer recovery or disposal. But only a few issue Certificates of Data Destruction. Digissential leads with POPIA compliance, NIST wipes, and full chain-of-custody.

## Why recovery & secure disposal matter

- **Students:** lost dissertations or coursework.  
- **SMEs:** critical invoices, payroll, or client records.  
- **Everyone:** old hard drives, SSDs, or phones with private data.  

Recovery saves what matters. Disposal ensures no one else can ever access it.

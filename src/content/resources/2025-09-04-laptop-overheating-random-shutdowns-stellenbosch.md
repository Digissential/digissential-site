  steps:
    - "Shut down the device and let it cool on a hard, flat surface."
    - "Blow dust from vents using compressed air (short bursts only)."
    - "Check fan speed and CPU/GPU temperatures using free monitoring software."
    - "Avoid gaming or heavy loads until temperatures stabilise."
    - "If shutdowns continue, book a **Thermal Paste & Deep Clean** with Digissential."

    a: "Overheating triggers a safety shutdown to prevent hardware damage. Dust, old thermal paste, or failing fans are common causes."

> **TL;DR:** Overheating laptops and gaming PCs often shut down to protect hardware. Blow dust safely, monitor temps, and if issues persist, book a professional **thermal paste & deep clean**.

## Identify the problem

In Stellenbosch, gaming rigs and student laptops struggle with:
- Sudden shutdowns during Zoom calls or exams.  
- Fans revving loudly during gaming, even at moderate loads.  
- Laptops that feel hot to the touch near the keyboard or vents.  
- PCs throttling FPS mid-game due to thermal limits.  

Cape Town’s summer heat and local dust build-up make overheating a common issue.

## Safe steps (do this in order)

1. **Power down** and let the device cool before handling.  
2. **Place it on a hard, flat surface** — avoid beds or couches that block vents.  
3. **Use compressed air** to blow dust out of vents (short bursts; don’t tilt cans).  
4. **Check temps with free tools** (HWMonitor, Open Hardware Monitor).  
5. **Reduce load** — pause gaming or video rendering until stable.  
6. **If shutdowns persist**, book a [Thermal Paste & Deep Clean](/services/thermal-paste-deep-clean/) with Digissential.

## Do-nots

- Don’t use a hairdryer or vacuum — static and heat can damage components.  
- Don’t ignore repeated shutdowns — each one stresses hardware.  
- Don’t run heavy loads while the fan sounds like a jet engine.  
- Don’t attempt CPU/GPU repaste without training; fragile parts can crack.  

## Time & cost in Stellenbosch (realistic bands)

- **Basic dust clean & thermal check:** from R350.  
- **Thermal paste replacement + deep clean:** from R650.  
- **GPU/CPU upgrade with stress test:** from R400–R550 (labour only).  
- **Turnaround:** same-day in workshop; 1–2 days if full disassembly required.  

## When to stop DIY

- If fans keep spinning loudly even after dusting.  
- If CPU/GPU temps stay above 90°C under light use.  
- If your laptop shuts down mid-assignment or exam prep.  
- If you smell burning plastic or see smoke — stop and book service immediately.
